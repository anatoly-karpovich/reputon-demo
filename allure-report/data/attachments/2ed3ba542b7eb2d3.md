The entire tour was super enriching. Tim walked me around all the surrounding buildings, introduced their history and interesting anecdotes, and patiently answered all my questions. I’m really grateful to him! I also want to thank the two staff members in the lounge. Having a cup of hot chocolate in the winter felt amazing (unfortunately, I didn’t catch their names). The Rockefeller observation deck is truly fantastic! Unlike the Empire State Building, there are no suicide barriers blocking the view (and it still feels completely safe), so you can enjoy the full New York night skyline from outdoors. The Skylift is also awesome! Even though I’m afraid of heights, the night view of NYC from up there is absolutely unbeatable. The Beam experience was really fun too—imagining sitting on a beam like workers did nearly a century ago is such a unique opportunity (of course, with a safety harness). I also tried the guided premium experiences at the Empire State Building and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, but I have to say Rockefeller is the best! I highly recommend visiting Rockefeller and if possible, definitely try the guided tour. It’s absolutely worth it!

This place blends history, beauty, art, and pure New York energy in a way that feels both grand and welcoming. From the moment you step into the plaza, there is a unique atmosphere that makes you feel like you are standing in the heart of the city. The entire complex is clean, beautifully maintained, and full of life. The architecture is stunning classic, iconic, and timeless. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is equally impressive. During the daytime, you can appreciate the details of the buildings and the sculptures, and at night, the lights make everything look magical. One of the highlights for me was visiting the Top of the Rock Observation Deck. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. You get a full 360-degree view of New York City: Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and the endless skyline. Unlike some of the other famous viewpoints, the Top of the Rock gives you a clear and unobstructed view of the Empire State Building, which makes it perfect for photos. The staff were friendly, the entry process was smooth, and everything was organized very well. I also loved walking around the plaza area. There are so many shops, cafés, and restaurants around, making it a perfect place to spend a relaxed few hours. During the winter season, the entire center transforms with the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree and the ice-skating rink. Even if you are not visiting during Christmas, you can still feel the charm and the warmth of the place. The golden statue of Prometheus adds a beautiful artistic touch to the plaza area. Another thing I appreciated was the security and cleanliness. Despite the crowd, the area felt safe, managed, and very tourist-friendly. The guides and staff members around the center always seemed ready to help with directions or questions. If you love photography, this place is a dream. Every corner gives you a picture-perfect background the flags, the fountains, the art pieces, the tall buildings, and the vibrant street energy. It truly captures the spirit of New York. Overall, Rockefeller Center is a must-visit landmark. Whether you are a tourist exploring New York for the first time or someone who has lived here for years, this place never loses its charm. It offers a mix of culture, history, entertainment, and world-class views. My visit here was absolutely worth it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to the city. It’s one of those places that stays in your memory long after you leave. Definitely a 5-star experience"

It is breathtaking to see the city from every angle, especially on a clear and sunny day. One of the highlights was the beautiful rooftop restaurant, a perfect stop to enjoy a drink or a small bite while taking in the unbelievable view. It adds such a special touch to the whole experience. I also really enjoyed the short introductory movie about the history and story behind how this iconic place was built, it is very well done and adds so much meaning to the visit. After that, you go up for the tour, and you can truly take your time and enjoy every moment, especially when the weather is nice. If you are visiting New York, I highly recommend going up to Rockefeller Center, it is an experience you should not miss.

I really enjoyed all of the different inviting displays they used to tell the history of building the Rockefeller Center. Made it really fun and interactive. We learned a lot about all of the movies made there. But then the views¡ Amazing! The sun set while ẁe were there and I loved seeing the city at night. It would be on my top 10 things to do in NYC. I highly recommend you make it part of your NYC visit.

The tree is beautiful, the lights are magical, and the whole area feels like a real-life holiday movie. Yes, it’s crowded, but that’s part of the experience everyone is there to take in the same festive moment, and it’s totally worth braving the crowds. If you’re in NYC during the holidays, Rockefeller Center is a must-see. 🎄✨

The tree was being decorated, they had ice skating with music, Sam’s 5th ave decorated and much more. This is a busy spot but a must stop if you are in the area. Plenty of shopping areas and there are food options as well. Great for kids to see and the shop at the toy store or skate and get hot chocolate, go to the top of the rock for pictures and a view.

The courtyard with fountains and benches is very cozy. It's even more beautiful here with the festive winter decorations.

The tallest building in Ireland is around 15 storeys high so being on the 70th floor at the observation deck was a huge thrill. We signed up tot he Rockefeller centre email newsletter and had 10% off so we used the discount and for two people it worked out at $108 which was about €93 which was good value for what it was. There was no time limit and the experience was great. We would certainly do this again and it is worth it.

Interesting things about Rockefeller history. The rink is nice too, a lot of people skiing. There's a very large line to get a hot chocolate in front of the rink, maybe 1 mile without exaggerating :/ The picture on the beam is a nice experience! And if they have bad weather, you have the option to reschedule, that was nice.

It was really fun to go this Thanksgiving and see the tree and people ice skating on the rink. We would have ice skated ourselves, but it costs way too much. We can ice skate for free on a lake in Minnesota.

While the Empire State Building is great, Top of the Rock offers an unobstructed, breathtaking view of both the Empire State Building and Central Park. Ticket prices vary, but general admission starts at around $40-44 USD. It's absolutely worth every penny. For the best photos and experience, try to visit during sunset. The three different levels of outdoor observation decks give you plenty of space to enjoy the incredible 360-degree view. Highly recommend it

This place blends history, beauty, art, and pure New York energy in a way that feels both grand and welcoming. From the moment you step into the plaza, there is a unique atmosphere that makes you feel like you are standing in the heart of the city. The entire complex is clean, beautifully maintained, and full of life. The architecture is stunning classic, iconic, and timeless. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is equally impressive. During the daytime, you can appreciate the details of the buildings and the sculptures, and at night, the lights make everything look magical. One of the highlights for me was visiting the Top of the Rock Observation Deck. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. You get a full 360-degree view of New York City: Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and the endless skyline. Unlike some of the other famous viewpoints, the Top of the Rock gives you a clear and unobstructed view of the Empire State Building, which makes it perfect for photos. The staff were friendly, the entry process was smooth, and everything was organized very well. I also loved walking around the plaza area. There are so many shops, cafés, and restaurants around, making it a perfect place to spend a relaxed few hours. During the winter season, the entire center transforms with the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree and the ice-skating rink. Even if you are not visiting during Christmas, you can still feel the charm and the warmth of the place. The golden statue of Prometheus adds a beautiful artistic touch to the plaza area. Another thing I appreciated was the security and cleanliness. Despite the crowd, the area felt safe, managed, and very tourist-friendly. The guides and staff members around the center always seemed ready to help with directions or questions. If you love photography, this place is a dream. Every corner gives you a picture-perfect background the flags, the fountains, the art pieces, the tall buildings, and the vibrant street energy. It truly captures the spirit of New York. Overall, Rockefeller Center is a must-visit landmark. Whether you are a tourist exploring New York for the first time or someone who has lived here for years, this place never loses its charm. It offers a mix of culture, history, entertainment, and world-class views. My visit here was absolutely worth it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to the city. It’s one of those places that stays in your memory long after you leave. Definitely a 5-star experience"

It is breathtaking to see the city from every angle, especially on a clear and sunny day. One of the highlights was the beautiful rooftop restaurant, a perfect stop to enjoy a drink or a small bite while taking in the unbelievable view. It adds such a special touch to the whole experience. I also really enjoyed the short introductory movie about the history and story behind how this iconic place was built, it is very well done and adds so much meaning to the visit. After that, you go up for the tour, and you can truly take your time and enjoy every moment, especially when the weather is nice. If you are visiting New York, I highly recommend going up to Rockefeller Center, it is an experience you should not miss.

I really enjoyed all of the different inviting displays they used to tell the history of building the Rockefeller Center. Made it really fun and interactive. We learned a lot about all of the movies made there. But then the views¡ Amazing! The sun set while ẁe were there and I loved seeing the city at night. It would be on my top 10 things to do in NYC. I highly recommend you make it part of your NYC visit.

The tree is beautiful, the lights are magical, and the whole area feels like a real-life holiday movie. Yes, it’s crowded, but that’s part of the experience everyone is there to take in the same festive moment, and it’s totally worth braving the crowds. If you’re in NYC during the holidays, Rockefeller Center is a must-see. 🎄✨

The tree was being decorated, they had ice skating with music, Sam’s 5th ave decorated and much more. This is a busy spot but a must stop if you are in the area. Plenty of shopping areas and there are food options as well. Great for kids to see and the shop at the toy store or skate and get hot chocolate, go to the top of the rock for pictures and a view.

The tallest building in Ireland is around 15 storeys high so being on the 70th floor at the observation deck was a huge thrill. We signed up tot he Rockefeller centre email newsletter and had 10% off so we used the discount and for two people it worked out at $108 which was about €93 which was good value for what it was. There was no time limit and the experience was great. We would certainly do this again and it is worth it.

Interesting things about Rockefeller history. The rink is nice too, a lot of people skiing. There's a very large line to get a hot chocolate in front of the rink, maybe 1 mile without exaggerating :/ The picture on the beam is a nice experience! And if they have bad weather, you have the option to reschedule, that was nice.

It was really fun to go this Thanksgiving and see the tree and people ice skating on the rink. We would have ice skated ourselves, but it costs way too much. We can ice skate for free on a lake in Minnesota.

While the Empire State Building is great, Top of the Rock offers an unobstructed, breathtaking view of both the Empire State Building and Central Park. Ticket prices vary, but general admission starts at around $40-44 USD. It's absolutely worth every penny. For the best photos and experience, try to visit during sunset. The three different levels of outdoor observation decks give you plenty of space to enjoy the incredible 360-degree view. Highly recommend it

The entire tour was super enriching. Tim walked me around all the surrounding buildings, introduced their history and interesting anecdotes, and patiently answered all my questions. I’m really grateful to him! I also want to thank the two staff members in the lounge. Having a cup of hot chocolate in the winter felt amazing (unfortunately, I didn’t catch their names). The Rockefeller observation deck is truly fantastic! Unlike the Empire State Building, there are no suicide barriers blocking the view (and it still feels completely safe), so you can enjoy the full New York night skyline from outdoors. The Skylift is also awesome! Even though I’m afraid of heights, the night view of NYC from up there is absolutely unbeatable. The Beam experience was really fun too—imagining sitting on a beam like workers did nearly a century ago is such a unique opportunity (of course, with a safety harness). I also tried the guided premium experiences at the Empire State Building and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, but I have to say Rockefeller is the best! I highly recommend visiting Rockefeller and if possible, definitely try the guided tour. It’s absolutely worth it!

  - text: I’ve been to Rockefeller Center twice during the Christmas season, and it’s absolutely worth it. The tree is beautiful, the lights are magical, and the whole area feels like a real-life holiday movie. Yes, it’s crowded, but that’s part of the experience everyone is there to take in the same festive moment, and it’s totally worth braving the crowds. If you’re in NYC during the holidays, Rockefeller Center is a must-see. 🎄✨

  - text: Did a quick stop at Rockefeller Center on a weekend trip to NYC and it lived up to expectations. The tree was being decorated, they had ice skating with music, Sam’s 5th ave decorated and much more. This is a busy spot but a must stop if you are in the area. Plenty of shopping areas and there are food options as well. Great for kids to see and the shop at the toy store or skate and get hot chocolate, go to the top of the rock for pictures and a view.

The courtyard with fountains and benches is very cozy. It's even more beautiful here with the festive winter decorations.

  - text: This was an amazing experience. It was my first time ever in New York and I wanted to see something from a skyscraper. The tallest building in Ireland is around 15 storeys high so being on the 70th floor at the observation deck was a huge thrill. We signed up tot he Rockefeller centre email newsletter and had 10% off so we used the discount and for two people it worked out at $108 which was about €93 which was good value for what it was. There was no time limit and the experience was great. We would certainly do this again and it is worth it.

Interesting things about Rockefeller history. The rink is nice too, a lot of people skiing. There's a very large line to get a hot chocolate in front of the rink, maybe 1 mile without exaggerating :/ The picture on the beam is a nice experience! And if they have bad weather, you have the option to reschedule, that was nice.

It was really fun to go this Thanksgiving and see the tree and people ice skating on the rink. We would have ice skated ourselves, but it costs way too much. We can ice skate for free on a lake in Minnesota.

The moment you step into the plaza, the lights, the music, and the festive atmosphere make you feel like you’re in the middle of a holiday movie. The tree is beautifully decorated, and the way it sparkles at night is truly breathtaking.

  - text: Hands down, this is the best rooftop view in New York City! While the Empire State Building is great, Top of the Rock offers an unobstructed, breathtaking view of both the Empire State Building and Central Park. Ticket prices vary, but general admission starts at around $40-44 USD. It's absolutely worth every penny. For the best photos and experience, try to visit during sunset. The three different levels of outdoor observation decks give you plenty of space to enjoy the incredible 360-degree view. Highly recommend it

The courtyard with fountains and benches is very cozy. It's even more beautiful here with the festive winter decorations.

Interesting things about Rockefeller history. The rink is nice too, a lot of people skiing. There's a very large line to get a hot chocolate in front of the rink, maybe 1 mile without exaggerating :/ The picture on the beam is a nice experience! And if they have bad weather, you have the option to reschedule, that was nice.

The moment you step into the plaza, the lights, the music, and the festive atmosphere make you feel like you’re in the middle of a holiday movie. The tree is beautifully decorated, and the way it sparkles at night is truly breathtaking.

This place blends history, beauty, art, and pure New York energy in a way that feels both grand and welcoming. From the moment you step into the plaza, there is a unique atmosphere that makes you feel like you are standing in the heart of the city. The entire complex is clean, beautifully maintained, and full of life. The architecture is stunning classic, iconic, and timeless. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is equally impressive. During the daytime, you can appreciate the details of the buildings and the sculptures, and at night, the lights make everything look magical. One of the highlights for me was visiting the Top of the Rock Observation Deck. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. You get a full 360-degree view of New York City: Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and the endless skyline. Unlike some of the other famous viewpoints, the Top of the Rock gives you a clear and unobstructed view of the Empire State Building, which makes it perfect for photos. The staff were friendly, the entry process was smooth, and everything was organized very well. I also loved walking around the plaza area. There are so many shops, cafés, and restaurants around, making it a perfect place to spend a relaxed few hours. During the winter season, the entire center transforms with the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree and the ice-skating rink. Even if you are not visiting during Christmas, you can still feel the charm and the warmth of the place. The golden statue of Prometheus adds a beautiful artistic touch to the plaza area. Another thing I appreciated was the security and cleanliness. Despite the crowd, the area felt safe, managed, and very tourist-friendly. The guides and staff members around the center always seemed ready to help with directions or questions. If you love photography, this place is a dream. Every corner gives you a picture-perfect background the flags, the fountains, the art pieces, the tall buildings, and the vibrant street energy. It truly captures the spirit of New York. Overall, Rockefeller Center is a must-visit landmark. Whether you are a tourist exploring New York for the first time or someone who has lived here for years, this place never loses its charm. It offers a mix of culture, history, entertainment, and world-class views. My visit here was absolutely worth it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to the city. It’s one of those places that stays in your memory long after you leave. Definitely a 5-star experience"

The entire tour was super enriching. Tim walked me around all the surrounding buildings, introduced their history and interesting anecdotes, and patiently answered all my questions. I’m really grateful to him! I also want to thank the two staff members in the lounge. Having a cup of hot chocolate in the winter felt amazing (unfortunately, I didn’t catch their names). The Rockefeller observation deck is truly fantastic! Unlike the Empire State Building, there are no suicide barriers blocking the view (and it still feels completely safe), so you can enjoy the full New York night skyline from outdoors. The Skylift is also awesome! Even though I’m afraid of heights, the night view of NYC from up there is absolutely unbeatable. The Beam experience was really fun too—imagining sitting on a beam like workers did nearly a century ago is such a unique opportunity (of course, with a safety harness). I also tried the guided premium experiences at the Empire State Building and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, but I have to say Rockefeller is the best! I highly recommend visiting Rockefeller and if possible, definitely try the guided tour. It’s absolutely worth it!

This place blends history, beauty, art, and pure New York energy in a way that feels both grand and welcoming. From the moment you step into the plaza, there is a unique atmosphere that makes you feel like you are standing in the heart of the city. The entire complex is clean, beautifully maintained, and full of life. The architecture is stunning classic, iconic, and timeless. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is equally impressive. During the daytime, you can appreciate the details of the buildings and the sculptures, and at night, the lights make everything look magical. One of the highlights for me was visiting the Top of the Rock Observation Deck. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. You get a full 360-degree view of New York City: Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and the endless skyline. Unlike some of the other famous viewpoints, the Top of the Rock gives you a clear and unobstructed view of the Empire State Building, which makes it perfect for photos. The staff were friendly, the entry process was smooth, and everything was organized very well. I also loved walking around the plaza area. There are so many shops, cafés, and restaurants around, making it a perfect place to spend a relaxed few hours. During the winter season, the entire center transforms with the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree and the ice-skating rink. Even if you are not visiting during Christmas, you can still feel the charm and the warmth of the place. The golden statue of Prometheus adds a beautiful artistic touch to the plaza area. Another thing I appreciated was the security and cleanliness. Despite the crowd, the area felt safe, managed, and very tourist-friendly. The guides and staff members around the center always seemed ready to help with directions or questions. If you love photography, this place is a dream. Every corner gives you a picture-perfect background the flags, the fountains, the art pieces, the tall buildings, and the vibrant street energy. It truly captures the spirit of New York. Overall, Rockefeller Center is a must-visit landmark. Whether you are a tourist exploring New York for the first time or someone who has lived here for years, this place never loses its charm. It offers a mix of culture, history, entertainment, and world-class views. My visit here was absolutely worth it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to the city. It’s one of those places that stays in your memory long after you leave. Definitely a 5-star experience"

It is breathtaking to see the city from every angle, especially on a clear and sunny day. One of the highlights was the beautiful rooftop restaurant, a perfect stop to enjoy a drink or a small bite while taking in the unbelievable view. It adds such a special touch to the whole experience. I also really enjoyed the short introductory movie about the history and story behind how this iconic place was built, it is very well done and adds so much meaning to the visit. After that, you go up for the tour, and you can truly take your time and enjoy every moment, especially when the weather is nice. If you are visiting New York, I highly recommend going up to Rockefeller Center, it is an experience you should not miss.

I really enjoyed all of the different inviting displays they used to tell the history of building the Rockefeller Center. Made it really fun and interactive. We learned a lot about all of the movies made there. But then the views¡ Amazing! The sun set while ẁe were there and I loved seeing the city at night. It would be on my top 10 things to do in NYC. I highly recommend you make it part of your NYC visit.

The tree is beautiful, the lights are magical, and the whole area feels like a real-life holiday movie. Yes, it’s crowded, but that’s part of the experience everyone is there to take in the same festive moment, and it’s totally worth braving the crowds. If you’re in NYC during the holidays, Rockefeller Center is a must-see. 🎄✨

The tree was being decorated, they had ice skating with music, Sam’s 5th ave decorated and much more. This is a busy spot but a must stop if you are in the area. Plenty of shopping areas and there are food options as well. Great for kids to see and the shop at the toy store or skate and get hot chocolate, go to the top of the rock for pictures and a view.

The tallest building in Ireland is around 15 storeys high so being on the 70th floor at the observation deck was a huge thrill. We signed up tot he Rockefeller centre email newsletter and had 10% off so we used the discount and for two people it worked out at $108 which was about €93 which was good value for what it was. There was no time limit and the experience was great. We would certainly do this again and it is worth it.

Interesting things about Rockefeller history. The rink is nice too, a lot of people skiing. There's a very large line to get a hot chocolate in front of the rink, maybe 1 mile without exaggerating :/ The picture on the beam is a nice experience! And if they have bad weather, you have the option to reschedule, that was nice.

Bought tickets for entry 2 mins and they sent me to the front of the line, actually worked out great. Ate at the Weather Room, pretzel & hot chocolate were good, hotdog was ok. Didn't ride the beam or the lift thing, but if you're good with heights, would be fun.

The entire tour was super enriching. Tim walked me around all the surrounding buildings, introduced their history and interesting anecdotes, and patiently answered all my questions. I’m really grateful to him! I also want to thank the two staff members in the lounge. Having a cup of hot chocolate in the winter felt amazing (unfortunately, I didn’t catch their names). The Rockefeller observation deck is truly fantastic! Unlike the Empire State Building, there are no suicide barriers blocking the view (and it still feels completely safe), so you can enjoy the full New York night skyline from outdoors. The Skylift is also awesome! Even though I’m afraid of heights, the night view of NYC from up there is absolutely unbeatable. The Beam experience was really fun too—imagining sitting on a beam like workers did nearly a century ago is such a unique opportunity (of course, with a safety harness). I also tried the guided premium experiences at the Empire State Building and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, but I have to say Rockefeller is the best! I highly recommend visiting Rockefeller and if possible, definitely try the guided tour. It’s absolutely worth it!

This place blends history, beauty, art, and pure New York energy in a way that feels both grand and welcoming. From the moment you step into the plaza, there is a unique atmosphere that makes you feel like you are standing in the heart of the city. The entire complex is clean, beautifully maintained, and full of life. The architecture is stunning classic, iconic, and timeless. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is equally impressive. During the daytime, you can appreciate the details of the buildings and the sculptures, and at night, the lights make everything look magical. One of the highlights for me was visiting the Top of the Rock Observation Deck. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. You get a full 360-degree view of New York City: Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and the endless skyline. Unlike some of the other famous viewpoints, the Top of the Rock gives you a clear and unobstructed view of the Empire State Building, which makes it perfect for photos. The staff were friendly, the entry process was smooth, and everything was organized very well. I also loved walking around the plaza area. There are so many shops, cafés, and restaurants around, making it a perfect place to spend a relaxed few hours. During the winter season, the entire center transforms with the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree and the ice-skating rink. Even if you are not visiting during Christmas, you can still feel the charm and the warmth of the place. The golden statue of Prometheus adds a beautiful artistic touch to the plaza area. Another thing I appreciated was the security and cleanliness. Despite the crowd, the area felt safe, managed, and very tourist-friendly. The guides and staff members around the center always seemed ready to help with directions or questions. If you love photography, this place is a dream. Every corner gives you a picture-perfect background the flags, the fountains, the art pieces, the tall buildings, and the vibrant street energy. It truly captures the spirit of New York. Overall, Rockefeller Center is a must-visit landmark. Whether you are a tourist exploring New York for the first time or someone who has lived here for years, this place never loses its charm. It offers a mix of culture, history, entertainment, and world-class views. My visit here was absolutely worth it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to the city. It’s one of those places that stays in your memory long after you leave. Definitely a 5-star experience"

It is breathtaking to see the city from every angle, especially on a clear and sunny day. One of the highlights was the beautiful rooftop restaurant, a perfect stop to enjoy a drink or a small bite while taking in the unbelievable view. It adds such a special touch to the whole experience. I also really enjoyed the short introductory movie about the history and story behind how this iconic place was built, it is very well done and adds so much meaning to the visit. After that, you go up for the tour, and you can truly take your time and enjoy every moment, especially when the weather is nice. If you are visiting New York, I highly recommend going up to Rockefeller Center, it is an experience you should not miss.

I really enjoyed all of the different inviting displays they used to tell the history of building the Rockefeller Center. Made it really fun and interactive. We learned a lot about all of the movies made there. But then the views¡ Amazing! The sun set while ẁe were there and I loved seeing the city at night. It would be on my top 10 things to do in NYC. I highly recommend you make it part of your NYC visit.

The tree is beautiful, the lights are magical, and the whole area feels like a real-life holiday movie. Yes, it’s crowded, but that’s part of the experience everyone is there to take in the same festive moment, and it’s totally worth braving the crowds. If you’re in NYC during the holidays, Rockefeller Center is a must-see. 🎄✨

The tree was being decorated, they had ice skating with music, Sam’s 5th ave decorated and much more. This is a busy spot but a must stop if you are in the area. Plenty of shopping areas and there are food options as well. Great for kids to see and the shop at the toy store or skate and get hot chocolate, go to the top of the rock for pictures and a view.

The tallest building in Ireland is around 15 storeys high so being on the 70th floor at the observation deck was a huge thrill. We signed up tot he Rockefeller centre email newsletter and had 10% off so we used the discount and for two people it worked out at $108 which was about €93 which was good value for what it was. There was no time limit and the experience was great. We would certainly do this again and it is worth it.

Interesting things about Rockefeller history. The rink is nice too, a lot of people skiing. There's a very large line to get a hot chocolate in front of the rink, maybe 1 mile without exaggerating :/ The picture on the beam is a nice experience! And if they have bad weather, you have the option to reschedule, that was nice.

It was really fun to go this Thanksgiving and see the tree and people ice skating on the rink. We would have ice skated ourselves, but it costs way too much. We can ice skate for free on a lake in Minnesota.

While the Empire State Building is great, Top of the Rock offers an unobstructed, breathtaking view of both the Empire State Building and Central Park. Ticket prices vary, but general admission starts at around $40-44 USD. It's absolutely worth every penny. For the best photos and experience, try to visit during sunset. The three different levels of outdoor observation decks give you plenty of space to enjoy the incredible 360-degree view. Highly recommend it
