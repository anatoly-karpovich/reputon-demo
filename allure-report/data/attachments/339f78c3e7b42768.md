The view from the top is absolutely wonderful and the seasonal landscaping in the pedestrian area between the tower and 5th Avenue is pretty. The addition of food trucks is a nice touch, and the variety of restaurants inside is terrific. I could go on but I think y'all get the picture!

  - text: In the summer, there is a gorgeous outdoor courtyard where the ice rink is in the winter. It's a wonderful place with food, drink, or just looking at the beautiful building. The view from the top is absolutely wonderful and the seasonal landscaping in the pedestrian area between the tower and 5th Avenue is pretty. The addition of food trucks is a nice touch, and the variety of restaurants inside is terrific. I could go on but I think y'all get the picture!

  - text: In the summer, there is a gorgeous outdoor courtyard where the ice rink is in the winter. It's a wonderful place with food, drink, or just looking at the beautiful building. The view from the top is absolutely wonderful and the seasonal landscaping in the pedestrian area between the tower and 5th Avenue is pretty. The addition of food trucks is a nice touch, and the variety of restaurants inside is terrific. I could go on but I think y'all get the picture!

  - text: Rockefeller Center was pretty cool. Place to visit, You can go to a lot of shopping venues and see the great architecture. You can go up to the viewing platform Top Of The Rock and have a great view of the city, including a view of the Empire State Building and many more large skyscrapers. It was very cool going up in the nighttime to see all of the city lights. During the early morning, you can go there and see the NBC Today show outside and maybe have a chance to meet the crew and maybe be on television.
