We went up to the Top of the Rock and the views were absolutely incredible—especially at sunset. Walking around the plaza, you’re surrounded by iconic sights like the Prometheus statue and Channel Gardens. In the winter, the whole place transforms with the ice rink and that famous Christmas tree—truly magical. There are tons of shops, restaurants, and even NBC Studios, where you can take a behind-the-scenes tour. Tip: If you have the New York Pass, Top of the Rock is included—great value if you're visiting other landmarks too! Whether you’re into history, architecture, or just want to experience the NYC vibe, this place has it all. Highly recommended!"

This timing proved to be perfect, as there were virtually no lines, allowing for a seamless and enjoyable experience. The tour begins with a brief, engaging five-minute introductory video that provides context before you're swiftly transported to the 67th floor. What makes Top of the Rock stand out are its three distinct observation decks, each offering unique vantage points of the city. While all provide excellent views, the uppermost deck is undeniably the highlight. From this elevated position, the panoramic views of the New York City skyline are absolutely spectacular. The iconic Empire State Building, brilliantly illuminated against the night sky, is a central and captivating feature of the vista. This particular late-night excursion offered a remarkably serene atmosphere, far from the typical daytime crowds. It allowed ample time to truly appreciate the intricate details of the city's glittering expanse. For anyone planning a trip to New York City, a visit to Top of the Rock is an absolute essential, and I highly recommend considering a late-night weekday slot for a more unhurried and memorable experience."

There are two decks for viewing the city and you can see all the iconic buildings that make up the New York skyline. There is an indoor bar on the 69th floor as well as a souvenir stand.

Unlike crowded alternatives, the timed ticketing system keeps visits enjoyable while the Art Deco elevators add vintage charm. The unobstructed 360-degree views are spectacular, with the Empire State Building viewable to the south and Central Park's expanse visible to the north. Multi-level outdoor terraces provide excellent photo ops at comfortable heights. Ticket prices ranging from $34 - $61, the combination of iconic views, smooth operations, and knowledgeable staff justifies the cost. Sunset visits are beautiful, transitioning from daylight to glittering city lights. This is an essential NYC experience that captures the city's magnificent scale and beauty. Book tickets in advance and bring your sense of adventure!

I highly recommend making an online reservation for your ticket in advance—it really streamlines the process and helps you skip unnecessary wait times. The visit begins with a brief but informative four-minute video that provides a great overview of the Rockefeller Center’s history and its significance in New York City. Once you head up to the observation deck, the views are simply stunning. You get an incredible panoramic view of the city, including the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and Central Park. It’s truly a must-see whether you're visiting NYC for the first time or returning. Highly recommended for anyone looking to take in the city from above and learn a little history along the way!

We went as a family and thoroughly enjoyed the Top of the Rock—the views of Central Park and the Empire State Building were absolutely stunning on a clear summer day. The plaza was buzzing with people, and the architecture, sculptures, and surrounding shops added to the charm. We also took time to relax around the fountains and admire the Atlas statue across from St. Patrick’s Cathedral. It’s a well-maintained and clean area with lots of photo opportunities. A perfect place to soak in the essence of Midtown Manhattan.

The Manhattan skyline is very beautiful, and after reaching the top, there are still three floors from which to admire the view. You can walk around and see the skyline from different angles. I believe it would be even more spectacular on a clear day. A reminder that the wind is very strong at the top, so please be mindful of safety and dress warmly.

You can go up to the viewing platform Top Of The Rock and have a great view of the city, including a view of the Empire State Building and many more large skyscrapers. It was very cool going up in the nighttime to see all of the city lights. During the early morning, you can go there and see the NBC Today show outside and maybe have a chance to meet the crew and maybe be on television.

This timing proved to be perfect, as there were virtually no lines, allowing for a seamless and enjoyable experience. The tour begins with a brief, engaging five-minute introductory video that provides context before you're swiftly transported to the 67th floor. What makes Top of the Rock stand out are its three distinct observation decks, each offering unique vantage points of the city. While all provide excellent views, the uppermost deck is undeniably the highlight. From this elevated position, the panoramic views of the New York City skyline are absolutely spectacular. The iconic Empire State Building, brilliantly illuminated against the night sky, is a central and captivating feature of the vista. This particular late-night excursion offered a remarkably serene atmosphere, far from the typical daytime crowds. It allowed ample time to truly appreciate the intricate details of the city's glittering expanse. For anyone planning a trip to New York City, a visit to Top of the Rock is an absolute essential, and I highly recommend considering a late-night weekday slot for a more unhurried and memorable experience."

There are two decks for viewing the city and you can see all the iconic buildings that make up the New York skyline. There is an indoor bar on the 69th floor as well as a souvenir stand.

Unlike crowded alternatives, the timed ticketing system keeps visits enjoyable while the Art Deco elevators add vintage charm. The unobstructed 360-degree views are spectacular, with the Empire State Building viewable to the south and Central Park's expanse visible to the north. Multi-level outdoor terraces provide excellent photo ops at comfortable heights. Ticket prices ranging from $34 - $61, the combination of iconic views, smooth operations, and knowledgeable staff justifies the cost. Sunset visits are beautiful, transitioning from daylight to glittering city lights. This is an essential NYC experience that captures the city's magnificent scale and beauty. Book tickets in advance and bring your sense of adventure!

I highly recommend making an online reservation for your ticket in advance—it really streamlines the process and helps you skip unnecessary wait times. The visit begins with a brief but informative four-minute video that provides a great overview of the Rockefeller Center’s history and its significance in New York City. Once you head up to the observation deck, the views are simply stunning. You get an incredible panoramic view of the city, including the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and Central Park. It’s truly a must-see whether you're visiting NYC for the first time or returning. Highly recommended for anyone looking to take in the city from above and learn a little history along the way!

We went as a family and thoroughly enjoyed the Top of the Rock—the views of Central Park and the Empire State Building were absolutely stunning on a clear summer day. The plaza was buzzing with people, and the architecture, sculptures, and surrounding shops added to the charm. We also took time to relax around the fountains and admire the Atlas statue across from St. Patrick’s Cathedral. It’s a well-maintained and clean area with lots of photo opportunities. A perfect place to soak in the essence of Midtown Manhattan.

The Manhattan skyline is very beautiful, and after reaching the top, there are still three floors from which to admire the view. You can walk around and see the skyline from different angles. I believe it would be even more spectacular on a clear day. A reminder that the wind is very strong at the top, so please be mindful of safety and dress warmly.

It was very cool going up in the nighttime to see all of the city lights. During the early morning, you can go there and see the NBC Today show outside and maybe have a chance to meet the crew and maybe be on television.

Unlike crowded alternatives, the timed ticketing system keeps visits enjoyable while the Art Deco elevators add vintage charm. The unobstructed 360-degree views are spectacular, with the Empire State Building viewable to the south and Central Park's expanse visible to the north. Multi-level outdoor terraces provide excellent photo ops at comfortable heights. Ticket prices ranging from $34 - $61, the combination of iconic views, smooth operations, and knowledgeable staff justifies the cost. Sunset visits are beautiful, transitioning from daylight to glittering city lights. This is an essential NYC experience that captures the city's magnificent scale and beauty. Book tickets in advance and bring your sense of adventure!

We went as a family and thoroughly enjoyed the Top of the Rock—the views of Central Park and the Empire State Building were absolutely stunning on a clear summer day. The plaza was buzzing with people, and the architecture, sculptures, and surrounding shops added to the charm. We also took time to relax around the fountains and admire the Atlas statue across from St. Patrick’s Cathedral. It’s a well-maintained and clean area with lots of photo opportunities. A perfect place to soak in the essence of Midtown Manhattan.

The Manhattan skyline is very beautiful, and after reaching the top, there are still three floors from which to admire the view. You can walk around and see the skyline from different angles. I believe it would be even more spectacular on a clear day. A reminder that the wind is very strong at the top, so please be mindful of safety and dress warmly.

You can go up to the viewing platform Top Of The Rock and have a great view of the city, including a view of the Empire State Building and many more large skyscrapers. It was very cool going up in the nighttime to see all of the city lights. During the early morning, you can go there and see the NBC Today show outside and maybe have a chance to meet the crew and maybe be on television.

This timing proved to be perfect, as there were virtually no lines, allowing for a seamless and enjoyable experience. The tour begins with a brief, engaging five-minute introductory video that provides context before you're swiftly transported to the 67th floor. What makes Top of the Rock stand out are its three distinct observation decks, each offering unique vantage points of the city. While all provide excellent views, the uppermost deck is undeniably the highlight. From this elevated position, the panoramic views of the New York City skyline are absolutely spectacular. The iconic Empire State Building, brilliantly illuminated against the night sky, is a central and captivating feature of the vista. This particular late-night excursion offered a remarkably serene atmosphere, far from the typical daytime crowds. It allowed ample time to truly appreciate the intricate details of the city's glittering expanse. For anyone planning a trip to New York City, a visit to Top of the Rock is an absolute essential, and I highly recommend considering a late-night weekday slot for a more unhurried and memorable experience."

We went up to the Top of the Rock and the views were absolutely incredible—especially at sunset. Walking around the plaza, you’re surrounded by iconic sights like the Prometheus statue and Channel Gardens. In the winter, the whole place transforms with the ice rink and that famous Christmas tree—truly magical. There are tons of shops, restaurants, and even NBC Studios, where you can take a behind-the-scenes tour. Tip: If you have the New York Pass, Top of the Rock is included—great value if you're visiting other landmarks too! Whether you’re into history, architecture, or just want to experience the NYC vibe, this place has it all. Highly recommended!"

This timing proved to be perfect, as there were virtually no lines, allowing for a seamless and enjoyable experience. The tour begins with a brief, engaging five-minute introductory video that provides context before you're swiftly transported to the 67th floor. What makes Top of the Rock stand out are its three distinct observation decks, each offering unique vantage points of the city. While all provide excellent views, the uppermost deck is undeniably the highlight. From this elevated position, the panoramic views of the New York City skyline are absolutely spectacular. The iconic Empire State Building, brilliantly illuminated against the night sky, is a central and captivating feature of the vista. This particular late-night excursion offered a remarkably serene atmosphere, far from the typical daytime crowds. It allowed ample time to truly appreciate the intricate details of the city's glittering expanse. For anyone planning a trip to New York City, a visit to Top of the Rock is an absolute essential, and I highly recommend considering a late-night weekday slot for a more unhurried and memorable experience."

I highly recommend making an online reservation for your ticket in advance—it really streamlines the process and helps you skip unnecessary wait times. The visit begins with a brief but informative four-minute video that provides a great overview of the Rockefeller Center’s history and its significance in New York City. Once you head up to the observation deck, the views are simply stunning. You get an incredible panoramic view of the city, including the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and Central Park. It’s truly a must-see whether you're visiting NYC for the first time or returning. Highly recommended for anyone looking to take in the city from above and learn a little history along the way!

We went as a family and thoroughly enjoyed the Top of the Rock—the views of Central Park and the Empire State Building were absolutely stunning on a clear summer day. The plaza was buzzing with people, and the architecture, sculptures, and surrounding shops added to the charm. We also took time to relax around the fountains and admire the Atlas statue across from St. Patrick’s Cathedral. It’s a well-maintained and clean area with lots of photo opportunities. A perfect place to soak in the essence of Midtown Manhattan.

The Manhattan skyline is very beautiful, and after reaching the top, there are still three floors from which to admire the view. You can walk around and see the skyline from different angles. I believe it would be even more spectacular on a clear day. A reminder that the wind is very strong at the top, so please be mindful of safety and dress warmly.

I'm so glad we decided to pass through, it was fun to see in person, even in summer. Definitely worth the walk to see, not far from Times Square.

You can go up to the viewing platform Top Of The Rock and have a great view of the city, including a view of the Empire State Building and many more large skyscrapers. It was very cool going up in the nighttime to see all of the city lights. During the early morning, you can go there and see the NBC Today show outside and maybe have a chance to meet the crew and maybe be on television.

You can go up to the viewing platform Top Of The Rock and have a great view of the city, including a view of the Empire State Building and many more large skyscrapers. It was very cool going up in the nighttime to see all of the city lights. During the early morning, you can go there and see the NBC Today show outside and maybe have a chance to meet the crew and maybe be on television.

We went up to the Top of the Rock and the views were absolutely incredible—especially at sunset. Walking around the plaza, you’re surrounded by iconic sights like the Prometheus statue and Channel Gardens. In the winter, the whole place transforms with the ice rink and that famous Christmas tree—truly magical. There are tons of shops, restaurants, and even NBC Studios, where you can take a behind-the-scenes tour. Tip: If you have the New York Pass, Top of the Rock is included—great value if you're visiting other landmarks too!

It's amazing, no matter the time of year. I love the flower garden and the gold statue. Lots of people gather here, both locals and tourists. There are lots of seating areas. If you go to the top of the Rockefeller Center, it's best to schedule your tickets in advance so you don't miss it. It fills up fast.

This timing proved to be perfect, as there were virtually no lines, allowing for a seamless and enjoyable experience. The tour begins with a brief, engaging five-minute introductory video that provides context before you're swiftly transported to the 67th floor. What makes Top of the Rock stand out are its three distinct observation decks, each offering unique vantage points of the city. While all provide excellent views, the uppermost deck is undeniably the highlight. From this elevated position, the panoramic views of the New York City skyline are absolutely spectacular. The iconic Empire State Building, brilliantly illuminated against the night sky, is a central and captivating feature of the vista. This particular late-night excursion offered a remarkably serene atmosphere, far from the typical daytime crowds. It allowed ample time to truly appreciate the intricate details of the city's glittering expanse. For anyone planning a trip to New York City, a visit to Top of the Rock is an absolute essential, and I highly recommend considering a late-night weekday slot for a more unhurried and memorable experience."

  - text: Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center offers Manhattan's best observation deck experience. Unlike crowded alternatives, the timed ticketing system keeps visits enjoyable while the Art Deco elevators add vintage charm. The unobstructed 360-degree views are spectacular, with the Empire State Building viewable to the south and Central Park's expanse visible to the north. Multi-level outdoor terraces provide excellent photo ops at comfortable heights. Ticket prices ranging from $34 - $61, the combination of iconic views, smooth operations, and knowledgeable staff justifies the cost. Sunset visits are beautiful, transitioning from daylight to glittering city lights. This is an essential NYC experience that captures the city's magnificent scale and beauty. Book tickets in advance and bring your sense of adventure!

I highly recommend making an online reservation for your ticket in advance—it really streamlines the process and helps you skip unnecessary wait times. The visit begins with a brief but informative four-minute video that provides a great overview of the Rockefeller Center’s history and its significance in New York City. Once you head up to the observation deck, the views are simply stunning. You get an incredible panoramic view of the city, including the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and Central Park. It’s truly a must-see whether you're visiting NYC for the first time or returning. Highly recommended for anyone looking to take in the city from above and learn a little history along the way!

  - text: Iconic and historic landmark in New York City is perfect for people watching, taking in the scenery, and eating outdoors in nice weather. I've visited in both spring and winter. It's amazing, no matter the time of year. I love the flower garden and the gold statue. Lots of people gather here, both locals and tourists. There are lots of seating areas. If you go to the top of the Rockefeller Center, it's best to schedule your tickets in advance so you don't miss it. It fills up fast.

We went up to the Top of the Rock and the views were absolutely incredible—especially at sunset. Walking around the plaza, you’re surrounded by iconic sights like the Prometheus statue and Channel Gardens. In the winter, the whole place transforms with the ice rink and that famous Christmas tree—truly magical. There are tons of shops, restaurants, and even NBC Studios, where you can take a behind-the-scenes tour. Tip: If you have the New York Pass, Top of the Rock is included—great value if you're visiting other landmarks too! Whether you’re into history, architecture, or just want to experience the NYC vibe, this place has it all. Highly recommended!"

This timing proved to be perfect, as there were virtually no lines, allowing for a seamless and enjoyable experience. The tour begins with a brief, engaging five-minute introductory video that provides context before you're swiftly transported to the 67th floor. What makes Top of the Rock stand out are its three distinct observation decks, each offering unique vantage points of the city. While all provide excellent views, the uppermost deck is undeniably the highlight. From this elevated position, the panoramic views of the New York City skyline are absolutely spectacular. The iconic Empire State Building, brilliantly illuminated against the night sky, is a central and captivating feature of the vista. This particular late-night excursion offered a remarkably serene atmosphere, far from the typical daytime crowds. It allowed ample time to truly appreciate the intricate details of the city's glittering expanse. For anyone planning a trip to New York City, a visit to Top of the Rock is an absolute essential, and I highly recommend considering a late-night weekday slot for a more unhurried and memorable experience."

There are two decks for viewing the city and you can see all the iconic buildings that make up the New York skyline. There is an indoor bar on the 69th floor as well as a souvenir stand.

Unlike crowded alternatives, the timed ticketing system keeps visits enjoyable while the Art Deco elevators add vintage charm. The unobstructed 360-degree views are spectacular, with the Empire State Building viewable to the south and Central Park's expanse visible to the north. Multi-level outdoor terraces provide excellent photo ops at comfortable heights. Ticket prices ranging from $34 - $61, the combination of iconic views, smooth operations, and knowledgeable staff justifies the cost. Sunset visits are beautiful, transitioning from daylight to glittering city lights. This is an essential NYC experience that captures the city's magnificent scale and beauty. Book tickets in advance and bring your sense of adventure!

I highly recommend making an online reservation for your ticket in advance—it really streamlines the process and helps you skip unnecessary wait times. The visit begins with a brief but informative four-minute video that provides a great overview of the Rockefeller Center’s history and its significance in New York City. Once you head up to the observation deck, the views are simply stunning. You get an incredible panoramic view of the city, including the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and Central Park. It’s truly a must-see whether you're visiting NYC for the first time or returning. Highly recommended for anyone looking to take in the city from above and learn a little history along the way!

We went as a family and thoroughly enjoyed the Top of the Rock—the views of Central Park and the Empire State Building were absolutely stunning on a clear summer day. The plaza was buzzing with people, and the architecture, sculptures, and surrounding shops added to the charm. We also took time to relax around the fountains and admire the Atlas statue across from St. Patrick’s Cathedral. It’s a well-maintained and clean area with lots of photo opportunities. A perfect place to soak in the essence of Midtown Manhattan.

The Manhattan skyline is very beautiful, and after reaching the top, there are still three floors from which to admire the view. You can walk around and see the skyline from different angles. I believe it would be even more spectacular on a clear day. A reminder that the wind is very strong at the top, so please be mindful of safety and dress warmly.

  - text: Rockefeller Center was pretty cool. Place to visit, You can go to a lot of shopping venues and see the great architecture. You can go up to the viewing platform Top Of The Rock and have a great view of the city, including a view of the Empire State Building and many more large skyscrapers. It was very cool going up in the nighttime to see all of the city lights. During the early morning, you can go there and see the NBC Today show outside and maybe have a chance to meet the crew and maybe be on television.
