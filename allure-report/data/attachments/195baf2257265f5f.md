  - text: The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree is one of those classic NYC holiday spots that actually lives up to the hype. The tree is massive, covered in thousands of lights, and topped with a bright star that looks great in photos from pretty much any angle. The whole plaza feels super festive with the ice rink below, the lit-up angels, and the crowd energy, even if it’s a bit chaotic. It does get very crowded, especially in the evenings and on weekends, so be ready to move slowly and dodge lots of people taking photos. If you can, go later at night or on a weekday for a slightly calmer vibe. Overall, it’s a must-see holiday stop in NYC—touristy, yes, but totally worth it at least once.

The entire tour was super enriching. Tim walked me around all the surrounding buildings, introduced their history and interesting anecdotes, and patiently answered all my questions. I’m really grateful to him! I also want to thank the two staff members in the lounge. Having a cup of hot chocolate in the winter felt amazing (unfortunately, I didn’t catch their names). The Rockefeller observation deck is truly fantastic! Unlike the Empire State Building, there are no suicide barriers blocking the view (and it still feels completely safe), so you can enjoy the full New York night skyline from outdoors. The Skylift is also awesome! Even though I’m afraid of heights, the night view of NYC from up there is absolutely unbeatable. The Beam experience was really fun too—imagining sitting on a beam like workers did nearly a century ago is such a unique opportunity (of course, with a safety harness). I also tried the guided premium experiences at the Empire State Building and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, but I have to say Rockefeller is the best! I highly recommend visiting Rockefeller and if possible, definitely try the guided tour. It’s absolutely worth it!

This place blends history, beauty, art, and pure New York energy in a way that feels both grand and welcoming. From the moment you step into the plaza, there is a unique atmosphere that makes you feel like you are standing in the heart of the city. The entire complex is clean, beautifully maintained, and full of life. The architecture is stunning classic, iconic, and timeless. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is equally impressive. During the daytime, you can appreciate the details of the buildings and the sculptures, and at night, the lights make everything look magical. One of the highlights for me was visiting the Top of the Rock Observation Deck. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. You get a full 360-degree view of New York City: Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and the endless skyline. Unlike some of the other famous viewpoints, the Top of the Rock gives you a clear and unobstructed view of the Empire State Building, which makes it perfect for photos. The staff were friendly, the entry process was smooth, and everything was organized very well. I also loved walking around the plaza area. There are so many shops, cafés, and restaurants around, making it a perfect place to spend a relaxed few hours. During the winter season, the entire center transforms with the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree and the ice-skating rink. Even if you are not visiting during Christmas, you can still feel the charm and the warmth of the place. The golden statue of Prometheus adds a beautiful artistic touch to the plaza area. Another thing I appreciated was the security and cleanliness. Despite the crowd, the area felt safe, managed, and very tourist-friendly. The guides and staff members around the center always seemed ready to help with directions or questions. If you love photography, this place is a dream. Every corner gives you a picture-perfect background the flags, the fountains, the art pieces, the tall buildings, and the vibrant street energy. It truly captures the spirit of New York. Overall, Rockefeller Center is a must-visit landmark. Whether you are a tourist exploring New York for the first time or someone who has lived here for years, this place never loses its charm. It offers a mix of culture, history, entertainment, and world-class views. My visit here was absolutely worth it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to the city. It’s one of those places that stays in your memory long after you leave. Definitely a 5-star experience"

I really enjoyed all of the different inviting displays they used to tell the history of building the Rockefeller Center. Made it really fun and interactive. We learned a lot about all of the movies made there. But then the views¡ Amazing! The sun set while ẁe were there and I loved seeing the city at night. It would be on my top 10 things to do in NYC. I highly recommend you make it part of your NYC visit.

There were a lot of people, but everything felt well organized and moved smoothly, which made it enjoyable rather than overwhelming. What stood out most was the energy. People were in a genuinely good mood, taking photos, laughing, and clearly happy to be there. It felt festive and upbeat in the best way. And the tree was beautiful. Seeing it in person really lives up to the reputation. Bright, elegant, and impressive without feeling overdone. Definitely worth experiencing, especially during the holidays.

The tree was being decorated, they had ice skating with music, Sam’s 5th ave decorated and much more. This is a busy spot but a must stop if you are in the area. Plenty of shopping areas and there are food options as well. Great for kids to see and the shop at the toy store or skate and get hot chocolate, go to the top of the rock for pictures and a view.

I was a little disappointed in The FAO Schwartz toy store, wasn't the big toy store I remembered nearly 40 years ago. I would visit Rockefeller Center, NBC studios, nearby St. Patrick's Cathedral and Saks fifth Avenue we're all nearby

The Beam experience was really fun too—imagining sitting on a beam like workers did nearly a century ago is such a unique opportunity (of course, with a safety harness). I also tried the guided premium experiences at the Empire State Building and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, but I have to say Rockefeller is the best! I highly recommend visiting Rockefeller and if possible, definitely try the guided tour. It’s absolutely worth it!

This place blends history, beauty, art, and pure New York energy in a way that feels both grand and welcoming. From the moment you step into the plaza, there is a unique atmosphere that makes you feel like you are standing in the heart of the city. The entire complex is clean, beautifully maintained, and full of life. The architecture is stunning classic, iconic, and timeless. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is equally impressive. During the daytime, you can appreciate the details of the buildings and the sculptures, and at night, the lights make everything look magical. One of the highlights for me was visiting the Top of the Rock Observation Deck. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. You get a full 360-degree view of New York City: Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and the endless skyline. Unlike some of the other famous viewpoints, the Top of the Rock gives you a clear and unobstructed view of the Empire State Building, which makes it perfect for photos. The staff were friendly, the entry process was smooth, and everything was organized very well. I also loved walking around the plaza area. There are so many shops, cafés, and restaurants around, making it a perfect place to spend a relaxed few hours. During the winter season, the entire center transforms with the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree and the ice-skating rink. Even if you are not visiting during Christmas, you can still feel the charm and the warmth of the place. The golden statue of Prometheus adds a beautiful artistic touch to the plaza area. Another thing I appreciated was the security and cleanliness. Despite the crowd, the area felt safe, managed, and very tourist-friendly. The guides and staff members around the center always seemed ready to help with directions or questions. If you love photography, this place is a dream. Every corner gives you a picture-perfect background the flags, the fountains, the art pieces, the tall buildings, and the vibrant street energy. It truly captures the spirit of New York. Overall, Rockefeller Center is a must-visit landmark. Whether you are a tourist exploring New York for the first time or someone who has lived here for years, this place never loses its charm. It offers a mix of culture, history, entertainment, and world-class views. My visit here was absolutely worth it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to the city. It’s one of those places that stays in your memory long after you leave. Definitely a 5-star experience"

There were a lot of people, but everything felt well organized and moved smoothly, which made it enjoyable rather than overwhelming. What stood out most was the energy. People were in a genuinely good mood, taking photos, laughing, and clearly happy to be there. It felt festive and upbeat in the best way. And the tree was beautiful. Seeing it in person really lives up to the reputation. Bright, elegant, and impressive without feeling overdone. Definitely worth experiencing, especially during the holidays.

The tree was being decorated, they had ice skating with music, Sam’s 5th ave decorated and much more. This is a busy spot but a must stop if you are in the area. Plenty of shopping areas and there are food options as well. Great for kids to see and the shop at the toy store or skate and get hot chocolate, go to the top of the rock for pictures and a view.

I was a little disappointed in The FAO Schwartz toy store, wasn't the big toy store I remembered nearly 40 years ago. I would visit Rockefeller Center, NBC studios, nearby St. Patrick's Cathedral and Saks fifth Avenue we're all nearby

In winter, the famous ice rink adds a special magic to the area — skating here feels like a classic New York moment straight out of a movie. If you’re visiting the city during the colder months, skating at the rink is an absolute must.

Bought tickets for entry 2 mins and they sent me to the front of the line, actually worked out great. Ate at the Weather Room, pretzel & hot chocolate were good, hotdog was ok. Didn't ride the beam or the lift thing, but if you're good with heights, would be fun.

The tree is massive, covered in thousands of lights, and topped with a bright star that looks great in photos from pretty much any angle. The whole plaza feels super festive with the ice rink below, the lit-up angels, and the crowd energy, even if it’s a bit chaotic. It does get very crowded, especially in the evenings and on weekends, so be ready to move slowly and dodge lots of people taking photos. If you can, go later at night or on a weekday for a slightly calmer vibe. Overall, it’s a must-see holiday stop in NYC—touristy, yes, but totally worth it at least once.

The entire tour was super enriching. Tim walked me around all the surrounding buildings, introduced their history and interesting anecdotes, and patiently answered all my questions. I’m really grateful to him! I also want to thank the two staff members in the lounge. Having a cup of hot chocolate in the winter felt amazing (unfortunately, I didn’t catch their names). The Rockefeller observation deck is truly fantastic! Unlike the Empire State Building, there are no suicide barriers blocking the view (and it still feels completely safe), so you can enjoy the full New York night skyline from outdoors. The Skylift is also awesome! Even though I’m afraid of heights, the night view of NYC from up there is absolutely unbeatable.

There were a lot of people, but everything felt well organized and moved smoothly, which made it enjoyable rather than overwhelming. What stood out most was the energy. People were in a genuinely good mood, taking photos, laughing, and clearly happy to be there. It felt festive and upbeat in the best way. And the tree was beautiful. Seeing it in person really lives up to the reputation. Bright, elegant, and impressive without feeling overdone. Definitely worth experiencing, especially during the holidays.

The tree was being decorated, they had ice skating with music, Sam’s 5th ave decorated and much more. This is a busy spot but a must stop if you are in the area. Plenty of shopping areas and there are food options as well. Great for kids to see and the shop at the toy store or skate and get hot chocolate, go to the top of the rock for pictures and a view.

  - text: The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree is one of those classic NYC holiday spots that actually lives up to the hype. The tree is massive, covered in thousands of lights, and topped with a bright star that looks great in photos from pretty much any angle. The whole plaza feels super festive with the ice rink below, the lit-up angels, and the crowd energy, even if it’s a bit chaotic. It does get very crowded, especially in the evenings and on weekends, so be ready to move slowly and dodge lots of people taking photos. If you can, go later at night or on a weekday for a slightly calmer vibe. Overall, it’s a must-see holiday stop in NYC—touristy, yes, but totally worth it at least once.

This place blends history, beauty, art, and pure New York energy in a way that feels both grand and welcoming. From the moment you step into the plaza, there is a unique atmosphere that makes you feel like you are standing in the heart of the city. The entire complex is clean, beautifully maintained, and full of life. The architecture is stunning classic, iconic, and timeless. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is equally impressive. During the daytime, you can appreciate the details of the buildings and the sculptures, and at night, the lights make everything look magical. One of the highlights for me was visiting the Top of the Rock Observation Deck. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. You get a full 360-degree view of New York City: Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and the endless skyline. Unlike some of the other famous viewpoints, the Top of the Rock gives you a clear and unobstructed view of the Empire State Building, which makes it perfect for photos. The staff were friendly, the entry process was smooth, and everything was organized very well. I also loved walking around the plaza area. There are so many shops, cafés, and restaurants around, making it a perfect place to spend a relaxed few hours. During the winter season, the entire center transforms with the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree and the ice-skating rink. Even if you are not visiting during Christmas, you can still feel the charm and the warmth of the place. The golden statue of Prometheus adds a beautiful artistic touch to the plaza area. Another thing I appreciated was the security and cleanliness. Despite the crowd, the area felt safe, managed, and very tourist-friendly. The guides and staff members around the center always seemed ready to help with directions or questions. If you love photography, this place is a dream. Every corner gives you a picture-perfect background the flags, the fountains, the art pieces, the tall buildings, and the vibrant street energy. It truly captures the spirit of New York. Overall, Rockefeller Center is a must-visit landmark. Whether you are a tourist exploring New York for the first time or someone who has lived here for years, this place never loses its charm. It offers a mix of culture, history, entertainment, and world-class views. My visit here was absolutely worth it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to the city. It’s one of those places that stays in your memory long after you leave. Definitely a 5-star experience"

  - text: Did a quick stop at Rockefeller Center on a weekend trip to NYC and it lived up to expectations. The tree was being decorated, they had ice skating with music, Sam’s 5th ave decorated and much more. This is a busy spot but a must stop if you are in the area. Plenty of shopping areas and there are food options as well. Great for kids to see and the shop at the toy store or skate and get hot chocolate, go to the top of the rock for pictures and a view.

The courtyard with fountains and benches is very cozy. It's even more beautiful here with the festive winter decorations.

  - text: Top of the Rock observatory was good, went in the morning and there was less waiting. The Rockefeller plaza Christmas tree and skating rink were fun to see and there was festive holiday decorations And lighting. I was a little disappointed in The FAO Schwartz toy store, wasn't the big toy store I remembered nearly 40 years ago. I would visit Rockefeller Center, NBC studios, nearby St. Patrick's Cathedral and Saks fifth Avenue we're all nearby

The entire tour was super enriching. Tim walked me around all the surrounding buildings, introduced their history and interesting anecdotes, and patiently answered all my questions. I’m really grateful to him! I also want to thank the two staff members in the lounge. Having a cup of hot chocolate in the winter felt amazing (unfortunately, I didn’t catch their names). The Rockefeller observation deck is truly fantastic! Unlike the Empire State Building, there are no suicide barriers blocking the view (and it still feels completely safe), so you can enjoy the full New York night skyline from outdoors. The Skylift is also awesome! Even though I’m afraid of heights, the night view of NYC from up there is absolutely unbeatable. The Beam experience was really fun too—imagining sitting on a beam like workers did nearly a century ago is such a unique opportunity (of course, with a safety harness). I also tried the guided premium experiences at the Empire State Building and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, but I have to say Rockefeller is the best! I highly recommend visiting Rockefeller and if possible, definitely try the guided tour. It’s absolutely worth it!

There were a lot of people, but everything felt well organized and moved smoothly, which made it enjoyable rather than overwhelming. What stood out most was the energy. People were in a genuinely good mood, taking photos, laughing, and clearly happy to be there. It felt festive and upbeat in the best way. And the tree was beautiful. Seeing it in person really lives up to the reputation. Bright, elegant, and impressive without feeling overdone. Definitely worth experiencing, especially during the holidays.

  - text: Rockefeller Center is one of those places that truly captures the spirit of New York. The architecture, constant movement, and energy make it exciting at any time of day. In winter, the famous ice rink adds a special magic to the area — skating here feels like a classic New York moment straight out of a movie. If you’re visiting the city during the colder months, skating at the rink is an absolute must.

  - text: The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree is one of those classic NYC holiday spots that actually lives up to the hype. The tree is massive, covered in thousands of lights, and topped with a bright star that looks great in photos from pretty much any angle. The whole plaza feels super festive with the ice rink below, the lit-up angels, and the crowd energy, even if it’s a bit chaotic. It does get very crowded, especially in the evenings and on weekends, so be ready to move slowly and dodge lots of people taking photos. If you can, go later at night or on a weekday for a slightly calmer vibe. Overall, it’s a must-see holiday stop in NYC—touristy, yes, but totally worth it at least once.

I’m really grateful to him! I also want to thank the two staff members in the lounge. Having a cup of hot chocolate in the winter felt amazing (unfortunately, I didn’t catch their names). The Rockefeller observation deck is truly fantastic! Unlike the Empire State Building, there are no suicide barriers blocking the view (and it still feels completely safe), so you can enjoy the full New York night skyline from outdoors. The Skylift is also awesome! Even though I’m afraid of heights, the night view of NYC from up there is absolutely unbeatable. The Beam experience was really fun too—imagining sitting on a beam like workers did nearly a century ago is such a unique opportunity (of course, with a safety harness). I also tried the guided premium experiences at the Empire State Building and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, but I have to say Rockefeller is the best! I highly recommend visiting Rockefeller and if possible, definitely try the guided tour. It’s absolutely worth it!

This place blends history, beauty, art, and pure New York energy in a way that feels both grand and welcoming. From the moment you step into the plaza, there is a unique atmosphere that makes you feel like you are standing in the heart of the city. The entire complex is clean, beautifully maintained, and full of life. The architecture is stunning classic, iconic, and timeless. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is equally impressive. During the daytime, you can appreciate the details of the buildings and the sculptures, and at night, the lights make everything look magical. One of the highlights for me was visiting the Top of the Rock Observation Deck. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. You get a full 360-degree view of New York City: Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and the endless skyline. Unlike some of the other famous viewpoints, the Top of the Rock gives you a clear and unobstructed view of the Empire State Building, which makes it perfect for photos. The staff were friendly, the entry process was smooth, and everything was organized very well. I also loved walking around the plaza area. There are so many shops, cafés, and restaurants around, making it a perfect place to spend a relaxed few hours. During the winter season, the entire center transforms with the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree and the ice-skating rink. Even if you are not visiting during Christmas, you can still feel the charm and the warmth of the place. The golden statue of Prometheus adds a beautiful artistic touch to the plaza area. Another thing I appreciated was the security and cleanliness. Despite the crowd, the area felt safe, managed, and very tourist-friendly. The guides and staff members around the center always seemed ready to help with directions or questions. If you love photography, this place is a dream. Every corner gives you a picture-perfect background the flags, the fountains, the art pieces, the tall buildings, and the vibrant street energy. It truly captures the spirit of New York. Overall, Rockefeller Center is a must-visit landmark. Whether you are a tourist exploring New York for the first time or someone who has lived here for years, this place never loses its charm. It offers a mix of culture, history, entertainment, and world-class views. My visit here was absolutely worth it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to the city. It’s one of those places that stays in your memory long after you leave. Definitely a 5-star experience"

I really enjoyed all of the different inviting displays they used to tell the history of building the Rockefeller Center. Made it really fun and interactive. We learned a lot about all of the movies made there. But then the views¡ Amazing! The sun set while ẁe were there and I loved seeing the city at night. It would be on my top 10 things to do in NYC. I highly recommend you make it part of your NYC visit.

There were a lot of people, but everything felt well organized and moved smoothly, which made it enjoyable rather than overwhelming. What stood out most was the energy. People were in a genuinely good mood, taking photos, laughing, and clearly happy to be there. It felt festive and upbeat in the best way. And the tree was beautiful. Seeing it in person really lives up to the reputation. Bright, elegant, and impressive without feeling overdone. Definitely worth experiencing, especially during the holidays.

The tree was being decorated, they had ice skating with music, Sam’s 5th ave decorated and much more. This is a busy spot but a must stop if you are in the area. Plenty of shopping areas and there are food options as well. Great for kids to see and the shop at the toy store or skate and get hot chocolate, go to the top of the rock for pictures and a view.

  - text: The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree is one of those classic NYC holiday spots that actually lives up to the hype. The tree is massive, covered in thousands of lights, and topped with a bright star that looks great in photos from pretty much any angle. The whole plaza feels super festive with the ice rink below, the lit-up angels, and the crowd energy, even if it’s a bit chaotic. It does get very crowded, especially in the evenings and on weekends, so be ready to move slowly and dodge lots of people taking photos. If you can, go later at night or on a weekday for a slightly calmer vibe. Overall, it’s a must-see holiday stop in NYC—touristy, yes, but totally worth it at least once.

In winter, the famous ice rink adds a special magic to the area — skating here feels like a classic New York moment straight out of a movie. If you’re visiting the city during the colder months, skating at the rink is an absolute must.

  - text: Rockefeller Center is one of those places that truly captures the spirit of New York. The architecture, constant movement, and energy make it exciting at any time of day. In winter, the famous ice rink adds a special magic to the area — skating here feels like a classic New York moment straight out of a movie. If you’re visiting the city during the colder months, skating at the rink is an absolute must.

Bought tickets for entry 2 mins and they sent me to the front of the line, actually worked out great. Ate at the Weather Room, pretzel & hot chocolate were good, hotdog was ok. Didn't ride the beam or the lift thing, but if you're good with heights, would be fun.

  - text: The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree is one of those classic NYC holiday spots that actually lives up to the hype. The tree is massive, covered in thousands of lights, and topped with a bright star that looks great in photos from pretty much any angle. The whole plaza feels super festive with the ice rink below, the lit-up angels, and the crowd energy, even if it’s a bit chaotic. It does get very crowded, especially in the evenings and on weekends, so be ready to move slowly and dodge lots of people taking photos. If you can, go later at night or on a weekday for a slightly calmer vibe. Overall, it’s a must-see holiday stop in NYC—touristy, yes, but totally worth it at least once.

The entire tour was super enriching. Tim walked me around all the surrounding buildings, introduced their history and interesting anecdotes, and patiently answered all my questions. I’m really grateful to him! I also want to thank the two staff members in the lounge. Having a cup of hot chocolate in the winter felt amazing (unfortunately, I didn’t catch their names). The Rockefeller observation deck is truly fantastic! Unlike the Empire State Building, there are no suicide barriers blocking the view (and it still feels completely safe), so you can enjoy the full New York night skyline from outdoors. The Skylift is also awesome! Even though I’m afraid of heights, the night view of NYC from up there is absolutely unbeatable. The Beam experience was really fun too—imagining sitting on a beam like workers did nearly a century ago is such a unique opportunity (of course, with a safety harness). I also tried the guided premium experiences at the Empire State Building and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, but I have to say Rockefeller is the best! I highly recommend visiting Rockefeller and if possible, definitely try the guided tour. It’s absolutely worth it!

This place blends history, beauty, art, and pure New York energy in a way that feels both grand and welcoming. From the moment you step into the plaza, there is a unique atmosphere that makes you feel like you are standing in the heart of the city. The entire complex is clean, beautifully maintained, and full of life. The architecture is stunning classic, iconic, and timeless. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is equally impressive. During the daytime, you can appreciate the details of the buildings and the sculptures, and at night, the lights make everything look magical. One of the highlights for me was visiting the Top of the Rock Observation Deck. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. You get a full 360-degree view of New York City: Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and the endless skyline. Unlike some of the other famous viewpoints, the Top of the Rock gives you a clear and unobstructed view of the Empire State Building, which makes it perfect for photos. The staff were friendly, the entry process was smooth, and everything was organized very well. I also loved walking around the plaza area. There are so many shops, cafés, and restaurants around, making it a perfect place to spend a relaxed few hours. During the winter season, the entire center transforms with the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree and the ice-skating rink. Even if you are not visiting during Christmas, you can still feel the charm and the warmth of the place. The golden statue of Prometheus adds a beautiful artistic touch to the plaza area. Another thing I appreciated was the security and cleanliness. Despite the crowd, the area felt safe, managed, and very tourist-friendly. The guides and staff members around the center always seemed ready to help with directions or questions. If you love photography, this place is a dream. Every corner gives you a picture-perfect background the flags, the fountains, the art pieces, the tall buildings, and the vibrant street energy. It truly captures the spirit of New York. Overall, Rockefeller Center is a must-visit landmark. Whether you are a tourist exploring New York for the first time or someone who has lived here for years, this place never loses its charm. It offers a mix of culture, history, entertainment, and world-class views. My visit here was absolutely worth it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to the city. It’s one of those places that stays in your memory long after you leave. Definitely a 5-star experience"

I really enjoyed all of the different inviting displays they used to tell the history of building the Rockefeller Center. Made it really fun and interactive. We learned a lot about all of the movies made there. But then the views¡ Amazing! The sun set while ẁe were there and I loved seeing the city at night. It would be on my top 10 things to do in NYC. I highly recommend you make it part of your NYC visit.

There were a lot of people, but everything felt well organized and moved smoothly, which made it enjoyable rather than overwhelming. What stood out most was the energy. People were in a genuinely good mood, taking photos, laughing, and clearly happy to be there. It felt festive and upbeat in the best way. And the tree was beautiful. Seeing it in person really lives up to the reputation. Bright, elegant, and impressive without feeling overdone. Definitely worth experiencing, especially during the holidays.

The tree was being decorated, they had ice skating with music, Sam’s 5th ave decorated and much more. This is a busy spot but a must stop if you are in the area. Plenty of shopping areas and there are food options as well. Great for kids to see and the shop at the toy store or skate and get hot chocolate, go to the top of the rock for pictures and a view.

I would visit Rockefeller Center, NBC studios, nearby St. Patrick's Cathedral and Saks fifth Avenue we're all nearby
