  - text: I had a perfect experience! I was very lucky to be the only VIP Rock Pass guest in my time slot :) My guide, Tim, knows absolutely everything about Rockefeller Center! The entire tour was super enriching. Tim walked me around all the surrounding buildings, introduced their history and interesting anecdotes, and patiently answered all my questions. I’m really grateful to him! I also want to thank the two staff members in the lounge. Having a cup of hot chocolate in the winter felt amazing (unfortunately, I didn’t catch their names). The Rockefeller observation deck is truly fantastic! Unlike the Empire State Building, there are no suicide barriers blocking the view (and it still feels completely safe), so you can enjoy the full New York night skyline from outdoors. The Skylift is also awesome! Even though I’m afraid of heights, the night view of NYC from up there is absolutely unbeatable. The Beam experience was really fun too—imagining sitting on a beam like workers did nearly a century ago is such a unique opportunity (of course, with a safety harness). I also tried the guided premium experiences at the Empire State Building and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, but I have to say Rockefeller is the best! I highly recommend visiting Rockefeller and if possible, definitely try the guided tour. It’s absolutely worth it!

This place blends history, beauty, art, and pure New York energy in a way that feels both grand and welcoming. From the moment you step into the plaza, there is a unique atmosphere that makes you feel like you are standing in the heart of the city. The entire complex is clean, beautifully maintained, and full of life. The architecture is stunning classic, iconic, and timeless. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is equally impressive. During the daytime, you can appreciate the details of the buildings and the sculptures, and at night, the lights make everything look magical. One of the highlights for me was visiting the Top of the Rock Observation Deck. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. You get a full 360-degree view of New York City: Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and the endless skyline. Unlike some of the other famous viewpoints, the Top of the Rock gives you a clear and unobstructed view of the Empire State Building, which makes it perfect for photos. The staff were friendly, the entry process was smooth, and everything was organized very well. I also loved walking around the plaza area. There are so many shops, cafés, and restaurants around, making it a perfect place to spend a relaxed few hours. During the winter season, the entire center transforms with the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree and the ice-skating rink. Even if you are not visiting during Christmas, you can still feel the charm and the warmth of the place. The golden statue of Prometheus adds a beautiful artistic touch to the plaza area. Another thing I appreciated was the security and cleanliness. Despite the crowd, the area felt safe, managed, and very tourist-friendly. The guides and staff members around the center always seemed ready to help with directions or questions. If you love photography, this place is a dream. Every corner gives you a picture-perfect background the flags, the fountains, the art pieces, the tall buildings, and the vibrant street energy. It truly captures the spirit of New York. Overall, Rockefeller Center is a must-visit landmark. Whether you are a tourist exploring New York for the first time or someone who has lived here for years, this place never loses its charm. It offers a mix of culture, history, entertainment, and world-class views. My visit here was absolutely worth it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to the city. It’s one of those places that stays in your memory long after you leave. Definitely a 5-star experience"

  - text: Such a great experience going to the observation deck at the Empire State Bldg. I really enjoyed all of the different inviting displays they used to tell the history of building the Rockefeller Center. Made it really fun and interactive. We learned a lot about all of the movies made there. But then the views¡ Amazing! The sun set while ẁe were there and I loved seeing the city at night. It would be on my top 10 things to do in NYC. I highly recommend you make it part of your NYC visit.

The tree is beautiful, the lights are magical, and the whole area feels like a real-life holiday movie. Yes, it’s crowded, but that’s part of the experience everyone is there to take in the same festive moment, and it’s totally worth braving the crowds. If you’re in NYC during the holidays, Rockefeller Center is a must-see. 🎄✨

The courtyard with fountains and benches is very cozy. It's even more beautiful here with the festive winter decorations.

  - text: This was an amazing experience. It was my first time ever in New York and I wanted to see something from a skyscraper. The tallest building in Ireland is around 15 storeys high so being on the 70th floor at the observation deck was a huge thrill. We signed up tot he Rockefeller centre email newsletter and had 10% off so we used the discount and for two people it worked out at $108 which was about €93 which was good value for what it was. There was no time limit and the experience was great. We would certainly do this again and it is worth it.

  - text: Hands down, this is the best rooftop view in New York City! While the Empire State Building is great, Top of the Rock offers an unobstructed, breathtaking view of both the Empire State Building and Central Park. Ticket prices vary, but general admission starts at around $40-44 USD. It's absolutely worth every penny. For the best photos and experience, try to visit during sunset. The three different levels of outdoor observation decks give you plenty of space to enjoy the incredible 360-degree view. Highly recommend it

The gardens are beautifully designed, with elegant fountains, sculptures, and seasonal decorations that make the place feel magical. Walking through it gives a unique perspective of the Rockefeller Center buildings and the city vibe around. It’s peaceful, picturesque, and a perfect spot to take photos or just enjoy a moment in the heart of Manhattan.

  - text: I went up there around 11 PM and it was the best decision. There’s no line and there’s not so many people at the top. You can take as many pictures of the stunning view as you want without worrying about the crowd. As far as I was told you can stay as long as you want to (up until 12AM). The view is 10/10. I’ve also been on top of the Ende but I think being on top of the rock is an experience in itself. Seeing the skating rink was also beautiful. Would recommend

The Top of the Rock offers breathtaking views in every direction – especially Central Park to the north and the Empire State Building to the south. A real highlight is The Beam, a tribute to the famous historic photo of workers on the steel beam – very cool and an unforgettable photo opportunity. The whole experience is smooth and well organized, with short waiting times and friendly staff. A true NYC classic that never disappoints. No waiting time on Saturday morning...

They are private and heated and offer cozy seating for up to 6 people. There is also a food and beverage service available.

We had access to everything including a private elevator on the big rooftop down to the bar. We had an amazing view, didn’t have to wait for anything and could skip every queue. We had so much time for everything and could properly enjoy this amazing experience and view. Would do it again anytime !!!

This place blends history, beauty, art, and pure New York energy in a way that feels both grand and welcoming. From the moment you step into the plaza, there is a unique atmosphere that makes you feel like you are standing in the heart of the city. The entire complex is clean, beautifully maintained, and full of life. The architecture is stunning classic, iconic, and timeless. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is equally impressive. During the daytime, you can appreciate the details of the buildings and the sculptures, and at night, the lights make everything look magical. One of the highlights for me was visiting the Top of the Rock Observation Deck. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. You get a full 360-degree view of New York City: Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and the endless skyline. Unlike some of the other famous viewpoints, the Top of the Rock gives you a clear and unobstructed view of the Empire State Building, which makes it perfect for photos. The staff were friendly, the entry process was smooth, and everything was organized very well. I also loved walking around the plaza area. There are so many shops, cafés, and restaurants around, making it a perfect place to spend a relaxed few hours. During the winter season, the entire center transforms with the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree and the ice-skating rink. Even if you are not visiting during Christmas, you can still feel the charm and the warmth of the place. The golden statue of Prometheus adds a beautiful artistic touch to the plaza area. Another thing I appreciated was the security and cleanliness. Despite the crowd, the area felt safe, managed, and very tourist-friendly. The guides and staff members around the center always seemed ready to help with directions or questions. If you love photography, this place is a dream. Every corner gives you a picture-perfect background the flags, the fountains, the art pieces, the tall buildings, and the vibrant street energy. It truly captures the spirit of New York. Overall, Rockefeller Center is a must-visit landmark. Whether you are a tourist exploring New York for the first time or someone who has lived here for years, this place never loses its charm. It offers a mix of culture, history, entertainment, and world-class views. My visit here was absolutely worth it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to the city. It’s one of those places that stays in your memory long after you leave. Definitely a 5-star experience"

I really enjoyed all of the different inviting displays they used to tell the history of building the Rockefeller Center. Made it really fun and interactive. We learned a lot about all of the movies made there. But then the views¡ Amazing! The sun set while ẁe were there and I loved seeing the city at night. It would be on my top 10 things to do in NYC. I highly recommend you make it part of your NYC visit.

The tree is beautiful, the lights are magical, and the whole area feels like a real-life holiday movie. Yes, it’s crowded, but that’s part of the experience everyone is there to take in the same festive moment, and it’s totally worth braving the crowds. If you’re in NYC during the holidays, Rockefeller Center is a must-see. 🎄✨

The tallest building in Ireland is around 15 storeys high so being on the 70th floor at the observation deck was a huge thrill. We signed up tot he Rockefeller centre email newsletter and had 10% off so we used the discount and for two people it worked out at $108 which was about €93 which was good value for what it was. There was no time limit and the experience was great. We would certainly do this again and it is worth it.

While the Empire State Building is great, Top of the Rock offers an unobstructed, breathtaking view of both the Empire State Building and Central Park. Ticket prices vary, but general admission starts at around $40-44 USD. It's absolutely worth every penny. For the best photos and experience, try to visit during sunset. The three different levels of outdoor observation decks give you plenty of space to enjoy the incredible 360-degree view. Highly recommend it

The gardens are beautifully designed, with elegant fountains, sculptures, and seasonal decorations that make the place feel magical. Walking through it gives a unique perspective of the Rockefeller Center buildings and the city vibe around. It’s peaceful, picturesque, and a perfect spot to take photos or just enjoy a moment in the heart of Manhattan.

You can take as many pictures of the stunning view as you want without worrying about the crowd. As far as I was told you can stay as long as you want to (up until 12AM). The view is 10/10. I’ve also been on top of the Ende but I think being on top of the rock is an experience in itself. Seeing the skating rink was also beautiful. Would recommend

The Top of the Rock offers breathtaking views in every direction – especially Central Park to the north and the Empire State Building to the south. A real highlight is The Beam, a tribute to the famous historic photo of workers on the steel beam – very cool and an unforgettable photo opportunity. The whole experience is smooth and well organized, with short waiting times and friendly staff. A true NYC classic that never disappoints. No waiting time on Saturday morning...

They are private and heated and offer cozy seating for up to 6 people. There is also a food and beverage service available.

The entire tour was super enriching. Tim walked me around all the surrounding buildings, introduced their history and interesting anecdotes, and patiently answered all my questions. I’m really grateful to him! I also want to thank the two staff members in the lounge. Having a cup of hot chocolate in the winter felt amazing (unfortunately, I didn’t catch their names). The Rockefeller observation deck is truly fantastic! Unlike the Empire State Building, there are no suicide barriers blocking the view (and it still feels completely safe), so you can enjoy the full New York night skyline from outdoors. The Skylift is also awesome! Even though I’m afraid of heights, the night view of NYC from up there is absolutely unbeatable. The Beam experience was really fun too—imagining sitting on a beam like workers did nearly a century ago is such a unique opportunity (of course, with a safety harness). I also tried the guided premium experiences at the Empire State Building and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, but I have to say Rockefeller is the best! I highly recommend visiting Rockefeller and if possible, definitely try the guided tour. It’s absolutely worth it!

One of the highlights for me was visiting the Top of the Rock Observation Deck. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking.

The staff were friendly, the entry process was smooth, and everything was organized very well. I also loved walking around the plaza area. There are so many shops, cafés, and restaurants around, making it a perfect place to spend a relaxed few hours. During the winter season, the entire center transforms with the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree and the ice-skating rink. Even if you are not visiting during Christmas, you can still feel the charm and the warmth of the place. The golden statue of Prometheus adds a beautiful artistic touch to the plaza area. Another thing I appreciated was the security and cleanliness. Despite the crowd, the area felt safe, managed, and very tourist-friendly.

It offers a mix of culture, history, entertainment, and world-class views. My visit here was absolutely worth it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to the city. It’s one of those places that stays in your memory long after you leave. Definitely a 5-star experience"

  - text: Such a great experience going to the observation deck at the Empire State Bldg. I really enjoyed all of the different inviting displays they used to tell the history of building the Rockefeller Center. Made it really fun and interactive. We learned a lot about all of the movies made there. But then the views¡ Amazing! The sun set while ẁe were there and I loved seeing the city at night. It would be on my top 10 things to do in NYC. I highly recommend you make it part of your NYC visit.

The tree is beautiful, the lights are magical, and the whole area feels like a real-life holiday movie.

If you’re in NYC during the holidays, Rockefeller Center is a must-see. 🎄✨

The courtyard with fountains and benches is very cozy. It's even more beautiful here with the festive winter decorations.

The tallest building in Ireland is around 15 storeys high so being on the 70th floor at the observation deck was a huge thrill. We signed up tot he Rockefeller centre email newsletter and had 10% off so we used the discount and for two people it worked out at $108 which was about €93 which was good value for what it was. There was no time limit and the experience was great. We would certainly do this again and it is worth it.

  - text: Hands down, this is the best rooftop view in New York City! While the Empire State Building is great, Top of the Rock offers an unobstructed, breathtaking view of both the Empire State Building and Central Park. Ticket prices vary, but general admission starts at around $40-44 USD. It's absolutely worth every penny. For the best photos and experience, try to visit during sunset. The three different levels of outdoor observation decks give you plenty of space to enjoy the incredible 360-degree view. Highly recommend it

The gardens are beautifully designed, with elegant fountains, sculptures, and seasonal decorations that make the place feel magical. Walking through it gives a unique perspective of the Rockefeller Center buildings and the city vibe around. It’s peaceful, picturesque, and a perfect spot to take photos or just enjoy a moment in the heart of Manhattan.

You can take as many pictures of the stunning view as you want without worrying about the crowd. As far as I was told you can stay as long as you want to (up until 12AM). The view is 10/10. I’ve also been on top of the Ende but I think being on top of the rock is an experience in itself. Seeing the skating rink was also beautiful. Would recommend

The Top of the Rock offers breathtaking views in every direction – especially Central Park to the north and the Empire State Building to the south. A real highlight is The Beam, a tribute to the famous historic photo of workers on the steel beam – very cool and an unforgettable photo opportunity. The whole experience is smooth and well organized, with short waiting times and friendly staff. A true NYC classic that never disappoints. No waiting time on Saturday morning...

If skating is not your thing but you like to watch instead, why not rent one of the Apres Skate Chalets for a 40-minute reservation. They are private and heated and offer cozy seating for up to 6 people. There is also a food and beverage service available.

We had access to everything including a private elevator on the big rooftop down to the bar. We had an amazing view, didn’t have to wait for anything and could skip every queue. We had so much time for everything and could properly enjoy this amazing experience and view. Would do it again anytime !!!

It was a great atmosphere and inside the building there are a lot of stores and restaurants to enjoy. Even though it was very crowded we still going a place to sit down upstairs.

  - text: I had a perfect experience! I was very lucky to be the only VIP Rock Pass guest in my time slot :) My guide, Tim, knows absolutely everything about Rockefeller Center! The entire tour was super enriching. Tim walked me around all the surrounding buildings, introduced their history and interesting anecdotes, and patiently answered all my questions. I’m really grateful to him! I also want to thank the two staff members in the lounge. Having a cup of hot chocolate in the winter felt amazing (unfortunately, I didn’t catch their names). The Rockefeller observation deck is truly fantastic! Unlike the Empire State Building, there are no suicide barriers blocking the view (and it still feels completely safe), so you can enjoy the full New York night skyline from outdoors. The Skylift is also awesome! Even though I’m afraid of heights, the night view of NYC from up there is absolutely unbeatable. The Beam experience was really fun too—imagining sitting on a beam like workers did nearly a century ago is such a unique opportunity (of course, with a safety harness). I also tried the guided premium experiences at the Empire State Building and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, but I have to say Rockefeller is the best! I highly recommend visiting Rockefeller and if possible, definitely try the guided tour. It’s absolutely worth it!

It was a great atmosphere and inside the building there are a lot of stores and restaurants to enjoy. Even though it was very crowded we still going a place to sit down upstairs.

  - text: I had a perfect experience! I was very lucky to be the only VIP Rock Pass guest in my time slot :) My guide, Tim, knows absolutely everything about Rockefeller Center! The entire tour was super enriching. Tim walked me around all the surrounding buildings, introduced their history and interesting anecdotes, and patiently answered all my questions. I’m really grateful to him! I also want to thank the two staff members in the lounge. Having a cup of hot chocolate in the winter felt amazing (unfortunately, I didn’t catch their names). The Rockefeller observation deck is truly fantastic! Unlike the Empire State Building, there are no suicide barriers blocking the view (and it still feels completely safe), so you can enjoy the full New York night skyline from outdoors. The Skylift is also awesome! Even though I’m afraid of heights, the night view of NYC from up there is absolutely unbeatable. The Beam experience was really fun too—imagining sitting on a beam like workers did nearly a century ago is such a unique opportunity (of course, with a safety harness). I also tried the guided premium experiences at the Empire State Building and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, but I have to say Rockefeller is the best! I highly recommend visiting Rockefeller and if possible, definitely try the guided tour. It’s absolutely worth it!

The tree is beautiful, the lights are magical, and the whole area feels like a real-life holiday movie. Yes, it’s crowded, but that’s part of the experience everyone is there to take in the same festive moment, and it’s totally worth braving the crowds. If you’re in NYC during the holidays, Rockefeller Center is a must-see. 🎄✨

The tallest building in Ireland is around 15 storeys high so being on the 70th floor at the observation deck was a huge thrill. We signed up tot he Rockefeller centre email newsletter and had 10% off so we used the discount and for two people it worked out at $108 which was about €93 which was good value for what it was. There was no time limit and the experience was great. We would certainly do this again and it is worth it.

You can take as many pictures of the stunning view as you want without worrying about the crowd. As far as I was told you can stay as long as you want to (up until 12AM). The view is 10/10. I’ve also been on top of the Ende but I think being on top of the rock is an experience in itself. Seeing the skating rink was also beautiful. Would recommend

This place blends history, beauty, art, and pure New York energy in a way that feels both grand and welcoming. From the moment you step into the plaza, there is a unique atmosphere that makes you feel like you are standing in the heart of the city. The entire complex is clean, beautifully maintained, and full of life. The architecture is stunning classic, iconic, and timeless. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is equally impressive. During the daytime, you can appreciate the details of the buildings and the sculptures, and at night, the lights make everything look magical. One of the highlights for me was visiting the Top of the Rock Observation Deck. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. You get a full 360-degree view of New York City: Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and the endless skyline. Unlike some of the other famous viewpoints, the Top of the Rock gives you a clear and unobstructed view of the Empire State Building, which makes it perfect for photos. The staff were friendly, the entry process was smooth, and everything was organized very well. I also loved walking around the plaza area. There are so many shops, cafés, and restaurants around, making it a perfect place to spend a relaxed few hours. During the winter season, the entire center transforms with the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree and the ice-skating rink. Even if you are not visiting during Christmas, you can still feel the charm and the warmth of the place. The golden statue of Prometheus adds a beautiful artistic touch to the plaza area. Another thing I appreciated was the security and cleanliness. Despite the crowd, the area felt safe, managed, and very tourist-friendly. The guides and staff members around the center always seemed ready to help with directions or questions. If you love photography, this place is a dream. Every corner gives you a picture-perfect background the flags, the fountains, the art pieces, the tall buildings, and the vibrant street energy. It truly captures the spirit of New York. Overall, Rockefeller Center is a must-visit landmark. Whether you are a tourist exploring New York for the first time or someone who has lived here for years, this place never loses its charm. It offers a mix of culture, history, entertainment, and world-class views. My visit here was absolutely worth it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to the city. It’s one of those places that stays in your memory long after you leave. Definitely a 5-star experience"

While the Empire State Building is great, Top of the Rock offers an unobstructed, breathtaking view of both the Empire State Building and Central Park. Ticket prices vary, but general admission starts at around $40-44 USD. It's absolutely worth every penny. For the best photos and experience, try to visit during sunset. The three different levels of outdoor observation decks give you plenty of space to enjoy the incredible 360-degree view. Highly recommend it

The Top of the Rock offers breathtaking views in every direction – especially Central Park to the north and the Empire State Building to the south. A real highlight is The Beam, a tribute to the famous historic photo of workers on the steel beam – very cool and an unforgettable photo opportunity. The whole experience is smooth and well organized, with short waiting times and friendly staff. A true NYC classic that never disappoints. No waiting time on Saturday morning...

While the Empire State Building is great, Top of the Rock offers an unobstructed, breathtaking view of both the Empire State Building and Central Park. Ticket prices vary, but general admission starts at around $40-44 USD. It's absolutely worth every penny. For the best photos and experience, try to visit during sunset. The three different levels of outdoor observation decks give you plenty of space to enjoy the incredible 360-degree view. Highly recommend it

The Top of the Rock offers breathtaking views in every direction – especially Central Park to the north and the Empire State Building to the south. A real highlight is The Beam, a tribute to the famous historic photo of workers on the steel beam – very cool and an unforgettable photo opportunity. The whole experience is smooth and well organized, with short waiting times and friendly staff. A true NYC classic that never disappoints. No waiting time on Saturday morning...

If skating is not your thing but you like to watch instead, why not rent one of the Apres Skate Chalets for a 40-minute reservation. They are private and heated and offer cozy seating for up to 6 people. There is also a food and beverage service available.

The entire tour was super enriching. Tim walked me around all the surrounding buildings, introduced their history and interesting anecdotes, and patiently answered all my questions. I’m really grateful to him! I also want to thank the two staff members in the lounge. Having a cup of hot chocolate in the winter felt amazing (unfortunately, I didn’t catch their names). The Rockefeller observation deck is truly fantastic! Unlike the Empire State Building, there are no suicide barriers blocking the view (and it still feels completely safe), so you can enjoy the full New York night skyline from outdoors. The Skylift is also awesome! Even though I’m afraid of heights, the night view of NYC from up there is absolutely unbeatable. The Beam experience was really fun too—imagining sitting on a beam like workers did nearly a century ago is such a unique opportunity (of course, with a safety harness). I also tried the guided premium experiences at the Empire State Building and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, but I have to say Rockefeller is the best! I highly recommend visiting Rockefeller and if possible, definitely try the guided tour. It’s absolutely worth it!

This place blends history, beauty, art, and pure New York energy in a way that feels both grand and welcoming. From the moment you step into the plaza, there is a unique atmosphere that makes you feel like you are standing in the heart of the city. The entire complex is clean, beautifully maintained, and full of life. The architecture is stunning classic, iconic, and timeless. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is equally impressive. During the daytime, you can appreciate the details of the buildings and the sculptures, and at night, the lights make everything look magical. One of the highlights for me was visiting the Top of the Rock Observation Deck. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. You get a full 360-degree view of New York City: Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and the endless skyline. Unlike some of the other famous viewpoints, the Top of the Rock gives you a clear and unobstructed view of the Empire State Building, which makes it perfect for photos. The staff were friendly, the entry process was smooth, and everything was organized very well. I also loved walking around the plaza area. There are so many shops, cafés, and restaurants around, making it a perfect place to spend a relaxed few hours. During the winter season, the entire center transforms with the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree and the ice-skating rink. Even if you are not visiting during Christmas, you can still feel the charm and the warmth of the place. The golden statue of Prometheus adds a beautiful artistic touch to the plaza area. Another thing I appreciated was the security and cleanliness. Despite the crowd, the area felt safe, managed, and very tourist-friendly. The guides and staff members around the center always seemed ready to help with directions or questions. If you love photography, this place is a dream. Every corner gives you a picture-perfect background the flags, the fountains, the art pieces, the tall buildings, and the vibrant street energy. It truly captures the spirit of New York. Overall, Rockefeller Center is a must-visit landmark. Whether you are a tourist exploring New York for the first time or someone who has lived here for years, this place never loses its charm. It offers a mix of culture, history, entertainment, and world-class views. My visit here was absolutely worth it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to the city. It’s one of those places that stays in your memory long after you leave. Definitely a 5-star experience"

I really enjoyed all of the different inviting displays they used to tell the history of building the Rockefeller Center. Made it really fun and interactive. We learned a lot about all of the movies made there. But then the views¡ Amazing! The sun set while ẁe were there and I loved seeing the city at night. It would be on my top 10 things to do in NYC. I highly recommend you make it part of your NYC visit.

If you’re in NYC during the holidays, Rockefeller Center is a must-see. 🎄✨

The tallest building in Ireland is around 15 storeys high so being on the 70th floor at the observation deck was a huge thrill. We signed up tot he Rockefeller centre email newsletter and had 10% off so we used the discount and for two people it worked out at $108 which was about €93 which was good value for what it was. There was no time limit and the experience was great. We would certainly do this again and it is worth it.

You can take as many pictures of the stunning view as you want without worrying about the crowd. As far as I was told you can stay as long as you want to (up until 12AM). The view is 10/10. I’ve also been on top of the Ende but I think being on top of the rock is an experience in itself. Seeing the skating rink was also beautiful. Would recommend

  - text: I had a perfect experience! I was very lucky to be the only VIP Rock Pass guest in my time slot :) My guide, Tim, knows absolutely everything about Rockefeller Center! The entire tour was super enriching. Tim walked me around all the surrounding buildings, introduced their history and interesting anecdotes, and patiently answered all my questions. I’m really grateful to him! I also want to thank the two staff members in the lounge. Having a cup of hot chocolate in the winter felt amazing (unfortunately, I didn’t catch their names). The Rockefeller observation deck is truly fantastic! Unlike the Empire State Building, there are no suicide barriers blocking the view (and it still feels completely safe), so you can enjoy the full New York night skyline from outdoors. The Skylift is also awesome! Even though I’m afraid of heights, the night view of NYC from up there is absolutely unbeatable. The Beam experience was really fun too—imagining sitting on a beam like workers did nearly a century ago is such a unique opportunity (of course, with a safety harness). I also tried the guided premium experiences at the Empire State Building and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt, but I have to say Rockefeller is the best! I highly recommend visiting Rockefeller and if possible, definitely try the guided tour. It’s absolutely worth it!

  - text: Such a great experience going to the observation deck at the Empire State Bldg. I really enjoyed all of the different inviting displays they used to tell the history of building the Rockefeller Center. Made it really fun and interactive. We learned a lot about all of the movies made there. But then the views¡ Amazing! The sun set while ẁe were there and I loved seeing the city at night. It would be on my top 10 things to do in NYC. I highly recommend you make it part of your NYC visit.

This place blends history, beauty, art, and pure New York energy in a way that feels both grand and welcoming. From the moment you step into the plaza, there is a unique atmosphere that makes you feel like you are standing in the heart of the city. The entire complex is clean, beautifully maintained, and full of life. The architecture is stunning classic, iconic, and timeless. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is equally impressive. During the daytime, you can appreciate the details of the buildings and the sculptures, and at night, the lights make everything look magical. One of the highlights for me was visiting the Top of the Rock Observation Deck. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. You get a full 360-degree view of New York City: Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and the endless skyline. Unlike some of the other famous viewpoints, the Top of the Rock gives you a clear and unobstructed view of the Empire State Building, which makes it perfect for photos. The staff were friendly, the entry process was smooth, and everything was organized very well. I also loved walking around the plaza area. There are so many shops, cafés, and restaurants around, making it a perfect place to spend a relaxed few hours. During the winter season, the entire center transforms with the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree and the ice-skating rink. Even if you are not visiting during Christmas, you can still feel the charm and the warmth of the place. The golden statue of Prometheus adds a beautiful artistic touch to the plaza area. Another thing I appreciated was the security and cleanliness. Despite the crowd, the area felt safe, managed, and very tourist-friendly. The guides and staff members around the center always seemed ready to help with directions or questions. If you love photography, this place is a dream. Every corner gives you a picture-perfect background the flags, the fountains, the art pieces, the tall buildings, and the vibrant street energy. It truly captures the spirit of New York. Overall, Rockefeller Center is a must-visit landmark. Whether you are a tourist exploring New York for the first time or someone who has lived here for years, this place never loses its charm. It offers a mix of culture, history, entertainment, and world-class views. My visit here was absolutely worth it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to the city. It’s one of those places that stays in your memory long after you leave. Definitely a 5-star experience"

The tallest building in Ireland is around 15 storeys high so being on the 70th floor at the observation deck was a huge thrill. We signed up tot he Rockefeller centre email newsletter and had 10% off so we used the discount and for two people it worked out at $108 which was about €93 which was good value for what it was. There was no time limit and the experience was great. We would certainly do this again and it is worth it.

While the Empire State Building is great, Top of the Rock offers an unobstructed, breathtaking view of both the Empire State Building and Central Park. Ticket prices vary, but general admission starts at around $40-44 USD. It's absolutely worth every penny. For the best photos and experience, try to visit during sunset. The three different levels of outdoor observation decks give you plenty of space to enjoy the incredible 360-degree view. Highly recommend it

The gardens are beautifully designed, with elegant fountains, sculptures, and seasonal decorations that make the place feel magical. Walking through it gives a unique perspective of the Rockefeller Center buildings and the city vibe around. It’s peaceful, picturesque, and a perfect spot to take photos or just enjoy a moment in the heart of Manhattan.

  - text: I went up there around 11 PM and it was the best decision. There’s no line and there’s not so many people at the top. You can take as many pictures of the stunning view as you want without worrying about the crowd. As far as I was told you can stay as long as you want to (up until 12AM). The view is 10/10. I’ve also been on top of the Ende but I think being on top of the rock is an experience in itself. Seeing the skating rink was also beautiful. Would recommend

  - text: An absolute must-see in New York City! The Rockefeller Center combines history, style, and one of the best observatory experiences in the city. The Top of the Rock offers breathtaking views in every direction – especially Central Park to the north and the Empire State Building to the south. A real highlight is The Beam, a tribute to the famous historic photo of workers on the steel beam – very cool and an unforgettable photo opportunity. The whole experience is smooth and well organized, with short waiting times and friendly staff. A true NYC classic that never disappoints. No waiting time on Saturday morning...

  - text: Although I didn't get a chance to see the Christmas tree (currently being installed) or the Prometheus sculpture (under restoration) during my trip, the place remains magical. An iconic location, full of film references. Everything was spotless, the ice rink was beautiful, there were plenty of staff, and security was excellent. Fabulous.

  - text: Become part of one of New York City’s most cherished traditions by skating beneath the world-famous Rockerfeller centre Christmas tree. If skating is not your thing but you like to watch instead, why not rent one of the Apres Skate Chalets for a 40-minute reservation. They are private and heated and offer cozy seating for up to 6 people. There is also a food and beverage service available.

  - text: A true landmark in the heart of the city — a must-visit! Enjoy the hustle and bustle of the surrounding activities and the vibrant energy all around. Consider taking an Uber instead of driving; parking in the area cost me $70 for just three hours. Be sure to allow extra time to get here, as traffic can be heavy and stop-and-go

  - text: We had Vip Tickets with the Family and James was our Tour Guide. Absolutely loved it !!! He was amazing and hilarious. We had access to everything including a private elevator on the big rooftop down to the bar. We had an amazing view, didn’t have to wait for anything and could skip every queue. We had so much time for everything and could properly enjoy this amazing experience and view. Would do it again anytime !!!

  - text: This place is so cute. It's a lot smaller then i imagined. We went in the summer so instead of an ice rink they had seating. It was a great atmosphere and inside the building there are a lot of stores and restaurants to enjoy. Even though it was very crowded we still going a place to sit down upstairs.
