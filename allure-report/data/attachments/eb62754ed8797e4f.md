We went up to the Top of the Rock and the views were absolutely incredible—especially at sunset. Walking around the plaza, you’re surrounded by iconic sights like the Prometheus statue and Channel Gardens. In the winter, the whole place transforms with the ice rink and that famous Christmas tree—truly magical. There are tons of shops, restaurants, and even NBC Studios, where you can take a behind-the-scenes tour. Tip: If you have the New York Pass, Top of the Rock is included—great value if you're visiting other landmarks too! Whether you’re into history, architecture, or just want to experience the NYC vibe, this place has it all. Highly recommended!"

The view from the top is absolutely wonderful and the seasonal landscaping in the pedestrian area between the tower and 5th Avenue is pretty. The addition of food trucks is a nice touch, and the variety of restaurants inside is terrific. I could go on but I think y'all get the picture!

It's amazing, no matter the time of year. I love the flower garden and the gold statue. Lots of people gather here, both locals and tourists. There are lots of seating areas. If you go to the top of the Rockefeller Center, it's best to schedule your tickets in advance so you don't miss it. It fills up fast.

They have an observation deck located on the 70th floor that offers 360-degree views of the city. It has multiple levels with both indoor and outdoor areas. Having a 360-degree view of the city during the night hours is really very fascinating.

This timing proved to be perfect, as there were virtually no lines, allowing for a seamless and enjoyable experience. The tour begins with a brief, engaging five-minute introductory video that provides context before you're swiftly transported to the 67th floor. What makes Top of the Rock stand out are its three distinct observation decks, each offering unique vantage points of the city. While all provide excellent views, the uppermost deck is undeniably the highlight. From this elevated position, the panoramic views of the New York City skyline are absolutely spectacular. The iconic Empire State Building, brilliantly illuminated against the night sky, is a central and captivating feature of the vista. This particular late-night excursion offered a remarkably serene atmosphere, far from the typical daytime crowds. It allowed ample time to truly appreciate the intricate details of the city's glittering expanse. For anyone planning a trip to New York City, a visit to Top of the Rock is an absolute essential, and I highly recommend considering a late-night weekday slot for a more unhurried and memorable experience."

There are two decks for viewing the city and you can see all the iconic buildings that make up the New York skyline. There is an indoor bar on the 69th floor as well as a souvenir stand.

We went as a family and thoroughly enjoyed the Top of the Rock—the views of Central Park and the Empire State Building were absolutely stunning on a clear summer day. The plaza was buzzing with people, and the architecture, sculptures, and surrounding shops added to the charm. We also took time to relax around the fountains and admire the Atlas statue across from St. Patrick’s Cathedral. It’s a well-maintained and clean area with lots of photo opportunities. A perfect place to soak in the essence of Midtown Manhattan.

The Manhattan skyline is very beautiful, and after reaching the top, there are still three floors from which to admire the view. You can walk around and see the skyline from different angles. I believe it would be even more spectacular on a clear day. A reminder that the wind is very strong at the top, so please be mindful of safety and dress warmly.

The view from the top is absolutely wonderful and the seasonal landscaping in the pedestrian area between the tower and 5th Avenue is pretty. The addition of food trucks is a nice touch, and the variety of restaurants inside is terrific. I could go on but I think y'all get the picture!

This timing proved to be perfect, as there were virtually no lines, allowing for a seamless and enjoyable experience. The tour begins with a brief, engaging five-minute introductory video that provides context before you're swiftly transported to the 67th floor. What makes Top of the Rock stand out are its three distinct observation decks, each offering unique vantage points of the city. While all provide excellent views, the uppermost deck is undeniably the highlight. From this elevated position, the panoramic views of the New York City skyline are absolutely spectacular. The iconic Empire State Building, brilliantly illuminated against the night sky, is a central and captivating feature of the vista. This particular late-night excursion offered a remarkably serene atmosphere, far from the typical daytime crowds. It allowed ample time to truly appreciate the intricate details of the city's glittering expanse. For anyone planning a trip to New York City, a visit to Top of the Rock is an absolute essential, and I highly recommend considering a late-night weekday slot for a more unhurried and memorable experience."

There are two decks for viewing the city and you can see all the iconic buildings that make up the New York skyline. There is an indoor bar on the 69th floor as well as a souvenir stand.

We went as a family and thoroughly enjoyed the Top of the Rock—the views of Central Park and the Empire State Building were absolutely stunning on a clear summer day. The plaza was buzzing with people, and the architecture, sculptures, and surrounding shops added to the charm. We also took time to relax around the fountains and admire the Atlas statue across from St. Patrick’s Cathedral. It’s a well-maintained and clean area with lots of photo opportunities. A perfect place to soak in the essence of Midtown Manhattan.

The Manhattan skyline is very beautiful, and after reaching the top, there are still three floors from which to admire the view. You can walk around and see the skyline from different angles. I believe it would be even more spectacular on a clear day. A reminder that the wind is very strong at the top, so please be mindful of safety and dress warmly.

Whether you’re interested in history, architecture, shopping, or just soaking in the NYC vibe, Rockefeller Center delivers on all fronts. It’s a vibrant, energetic hub that captures the spirit of the city, making it an unforgettable stop on any NYC itinerary.

This timing proved to be perfect, as there were virtually no lines, allowing for a seamless and enjoyable experience. The tour begins with a brief, engaging five-minute introductory video that provides context before you're swiftly transported to the 67th floor. What makes Top of the Rock stand out are its three distinct observation decks, each offering unique vantage points of the city. While all provide excellent views, the uppermost deck is undeniably the highlight. From this elevated position, the panoramic views of the New York City skyline are absolutely spectacular. The iconic Empire State Building, brilliantly illuminated against the night sky, is a central and captivating feature of the vista. This particular late-night excursion offered a remarkably serene atmosphere, far from the typical daytime crowds. It allowed ample time to truly appreciate the intricate details of the city's glittering expanse. For anyone planning a trip to New York City, a visit to Top of the Rock is an absolute essential, and I highly recommend considering a late-night weekday slot for a more unhurried and memorable experience."

There are two decks for viewing the city and you can see all the iconic buildings that make up the New York skyline. There is an indoor bar on the 69th floor as well as a souvenir stand.

We went as a family and thoroughly enjoyed the Top of the Rock—the views of Central Park and the Empire State Building were absolutely stunning on a clear summer day. The plaza was buzzing with people, and the architecture, sculptures, and surrounding shops added to the charm. We also took time to relax around the fountains and admire the Atlas statue across from St. Patrick’s Cathedral. It’s a well-maintained and clean area with lots of photo opportunities. A perfect place to soak in the essence of Midtown Manhattan.

The Manhattan skyline is very beautiful, and after reaching the top, there are still three floors from which to admire the view. You can walk around and see the skyline from different angles. I believe it would be even more spectacular on a clear day. A reminder that the wind is very strong at the top, so please be mindful of safety and dress warmly.

For anyone planning a trip to New York City, a visit to Top of the Rock is an absolute essential, and I highly recommend considering a late-night weekday slot for a more unhurried and memorable experience."

Unlike crowded alternatives, the timed ticketing system keeps visits enjoyable while the Art Deco elevators add vintage charm. The unobstructed 360-degree views are spectacular, with the Empire State Building viewable to the south and Central Park's expanse visible to the north. Multi-level outdoor terraces provide excellent photo ops at comfortable heights. Ticket prices ranging from $34 - $61, the combination of iconic views, smooth operations, and knowledgeable staff justifies the cost. Sunset visits are beautiful, transitioning from daylight to glittering city lights. This is an essential NYC experience that captures the city's magnificent scale and beauty. Book tickets in advance and bring your sense of adventure!

We also took time to relax around the fountains and admire the Atlas statue across from St. Patrick’s Cathedral. It’s a well-maintained and clean area with lots of photo opportunities. A perfect place to soak in the essence of Midtown Manhattan.

The Manhattan skyline is very beautiful, and after reaching the top, there are still three floors from which to admire the view. You can walk around and see the skyline from different angles. I believe it would be even more spectacular on a clear day. A reminder that the wind is very strong at the top, so please be mindful of safety and dress warmly.

We went up to the Top of the Rock and the views were absolutely incredible—especially at sunset. Walking around the plaza, you’re surrounded by iconic sights like the Prometheus statue and Channel Gardens. In the winter, the whole place transforms with the ice rink and that famous Christmas tree—truly magical. There are tons of shops, restaurants, and even NBC Studios, where you can take a behind-the-scenes tour. Tip: If you have the New York Pass, Top of the Rock is included—great value if you're visiting other landmarks too! Whether you’re into history, architecture, or just want to experience the NYC vibe, this place has it all. Highly recommended!"

Unlike crowded alternatives, the timed ticketing system keeps visits enjoyable while the Art Deco elevators add vintage charm. The unobstructed 360-degree views are spectacular, with the Empire State Building viewable to the south and Central Park's expanse visible to the north. Multi-level outdoor terraces provide excellent photo ops at comfortable heights. Ticket prices ranging from $34 - $61, the combination of iconic views, smooth operations, and knowledgeable staff justifies the cost. Sunset visits are beautiful, transitioning from daylight to glittering city lights. This is an essential NYC experience that captures the city's magnificent scale and beauty. Book tickets in advance and bring your sense of adventure!

The view from the top is absolutely wonderful and the seasonal landscaping in the pedestrian area between the tower and 5th Avenue is pretty. The addition of food trucks is a nice touch, and the variety of restaurants inside is terrific. I could go on but I think y'all get the picture!

It's amazing, no matter the time of year. I love the flower garden and the gold statue. Lots of people gather here, both locals and tourists. There are lots of seating areas. If you go to the top of the Rockefeller Center, it's best to schedule your tickets in advance so you don't miss it. It fills up fast.

They have an observation deck located on the 70th floor that offers 360-degree views of the city. It has multiple levels with both indoor and outdoor areas. Having a 360-degree view of the city during the night hours is really very fascinating.

This timing proved to be perfect, as there were virtually no lines, allowing for a seamless and enjoyable experience. The tour begins with a brief, engaging five-minute introductory video that provides context before you're swiftly transported to the 67th floor. What makes Top of the Rock stand out are its three distinct observation decks, each offering unique vantage points of the city. While all provide excellent views, the uppermost deck is undeniably the highlight. From this elevated position, the panoramic views of the New York City skyline are absolutely spectacular. The iconic Empire State Building, brilliantly illuminated against the night sky, is a central and captivating feature of the vista. This particular late-night excursion offered a remarkably serene atmosphere, far from the typical daytime crowds. It allowed ample time to truly appreciate the intricate details of the city's glittering expanse. For anyone planning a trip to New York City, a visit to Top of the Rock is an absolute essential, and I highly recommend considering a late-night weekday slot for a more unhurried and memorable experience."

  - text: Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center offers Manhattan's best observation deck experience. Unlike crowded alternatives, the timed ticketing system keeps visits enjoyable while the Art Deco elevators add vintage charm. The unobstructed 360-degree views are spectacular, with the Empire State Building viewable to the south and Central Park's expanse visible to the north. Multi-level outdoor terraces provide excellent photo ops at comfortable heights. Ticket prices ranging from $34 - $61, the combination of iconic views, smooth operations, and knowledgeable staff justifies the cost. Sunset visits are beautiful, transitioning from daylight to glittering city lights. This is an essential NYC experience that captures the city's magnificent scale and beauty. Book tickets in advance and bring your sense of adventure!

The view from the top is absolutely wonderful and the seasonal landscaping in the pedestrian area between the tower and 5th Avenue is pretty. The addition of food trucks is a nice touch, and the variety of restaurants inside is terrific. I could go on but I think y'all get the picture!

The views of the New York City skyline were absolutely stunning especially seeing the Empire State Building and Central Park from above. The entire process was smooth, and the staff were friendly and helpful. The observation decks are spacious, giving you plenty of room to take in the views and grab great photos. Definitely one of the best spots in NYC for panoramic views. Highly recommend!

  - text: Iconic and historic landmark in New York City is perfect for people watching, taking in the scenery, and eating outdoors in nice weather. I've visited in both spring and winter. It's amazing, no matter the time of year. I love the flower garden and the gold statue. Lots of people gather here, both locals and tourists. There are lots of seating areas. If you go to the top of the Rockefeller Center, it's best to schedule your tickets in advance so you don't miss it. It fills up fast.

Loved all of the big tables they had on the one side (forgot to take a picture). Very impressed with how beautiful and clean everything looked. Another wonderful NYC spot!

  - text: Rockefeller Center is a complex of 19 commercial buildings in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. They have an observation deck located on the 70th floor that offers 360-degree views of the city. It has multiple levels with both indoor and outdoor areas. Having a 360-degree view of the city during the night hours is really very fascinating.

The complex is home to the legendary Top of the Rock observation deck, offering breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline, especially at sunset. Walking through the plaza, you’re surrounded by Art Deco masterpieces and famous sights like the Prometheus statue and the Channel Gardens. During the winter, the ice skating rink and the massive Christmas tree create a magical, festive atmosphere that draws visitors from around the world. There are plenty of shops, restaurants, and even NBC Studios, where you can take a behind-the-scenes tour. Whether you’re interested in history, architecture, shopping, or just soaking in the NYC vibe, Rockefeller Center delivers on all fronts. It’s a vibrant, energetic hub that captures the spirit of the city, making it an unforgettable stop on any NYC itinerary.

This timing proved to be perfect, as there were virtually no lines, allowing for a seamless and enjoyable experience. The tour begins with a brief, engaging five-minute introductory video that provides context before you're swiftly transported to the 67th floor. What makes Top of the Rock stand out are its three distinct observation decks, each offering unique vantage points of the city. While all provide excellent views, the uppermost deck is undeniably the highlight. From this elevated position, the panoramic views of the New York City skyline are absolutely spectacular. The iconic Empire State Building, brilliantly illuminated against the night sky, is a central and captivating feature of the vista. This particular late-night excursion offered a remarkably serene atmosphere, far from the typical daytime crowds. It allowed ample time to truly appreciate the intricate details of the city's glittering expanse. For anyone planning a trip to New York City, a visit to Top of the Rock is an absolute essential, and I highly recommend considering a late-night weekday slot for a more unhurried and memorable experience."

There are two decks for viewing the city and you can see all the iconic buildings that make up the New York skyline. There is an indoor bar on the 69th floor as well as a souvenir stand.

  - text: Rockefeller Center was an unforgettable experience! Visiting in July meant no Christmas tree or skating rink, but the place still had a lively, energetic charm. We went as a family and thoroughly enjoyed the Top of the Rock—the views of Central Park and the Empire State Building were absolutely stunning on a clear summer day. The plaza was buzzing with people, and the architecture, sculptures, and surrounding shops added to the charm. We also took time to relax around the fountains and admire the Atlas statue across from St. Patrick’s Cathedral. It’s a well-maintained and clean area with lots of photo opportunities. A perfect place to soak in the essence of Midtown Manhattan.

  - text: We came here to watch the sunset on a Thursday evening. Although it was a cloudy day, once we reached the top, we still enjoyed the unique and expansive view. The Manhattan skyline is very beautiful, and after reaching the top, there are still three floors from which to admire the view. You can walk around and see the skyline from different angles. I believe it would be even more spectacular on a clear day. A reminder that the wind is very strong at the top, so please be mindful of safety and dress warmly.
